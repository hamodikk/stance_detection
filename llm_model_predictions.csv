NC_Doc3.docx,"Transition 2025: What Will Trump Do About Iran? Posted by James M. Lindsay January 3, 2025, 5:29 pm (EST) One of the many complex foreign policy problems that Donald Trump will inherit when he takes office in just over two weeks is Iran. It is on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, its robust ballistic missile program continues to progress, and it sees the United States as the main obstacle to its domination of the Middle East. How will Trump respond? That question is easy to answer because Trump has been consistent about his plans: He will return to his first administration s policy of maximum pressure. That effort sought to turn the economic screws on Iran by expanding U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic and ratcheting up the enforcement of sanctions already in place. The goal was not regime change but rather forcing Tehran to limit its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and curb support for the regional militias that made up the so-called axis of resistance. Maximum pressure certainly squeezed the Iranian economy. It failed, however, to force Tehran to the bargaining table. Even as its economy faltered and its foreign reserves dwindled, Iran continued its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, expanded its support for its regional proxies, and even launched a missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq in 2020. Top of Form Bottom of Form Would the maximum pressure campaign have paid off had the Biden administration kept it in place? Trump thinks so. But that is for historians and partisans to debate. The question now is, will maximum pressure work in today s very different geopolitical context? The evidence on that score is mixed. Israel s wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, have weakened Iran s position in the region. Its proxies are fewer and weaker than just six months ago. Beyond that, Israel s October retaliatory air strikes destroyed much of Iran s air defenses, leaving it open to further military attacks. That vulnerability, coupled with Iran s economic woes and domestic unrest, may be why Iran s foreign minister said today that Iran is looking to resume nuclear talks. By the same token, however, a maximum pressure strategy takes time to work. That could be in short supply, at least when it comes to Iran s nuclear program. Iran intensified its uranium-enrichment efforts after Trump terminated the 2015 nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated. By most estimates, Iran can now build a small number of nuclear weapons within weeks of deciding to cross the nuclear threshold. Other great powers will also undermine the maximum pressure policy. China and Russia have both skirted or ignored existing U.S. and multilateral sanctions on Iran. They are unlikely to comply with them now unless they get something significant from the United States in return. Trump may be unwilling or unable to provide that enticement. If Tehran believes that Beijing and Moscow have its back, resistance becomes a more feasible strategy. Tehran could even use negotiations as a way to buy time to address its vulnerabilities. Even if Iran enters into negotiations in good faith, Trump s efforts could stumble over deciding what deal is good enough. The ideological diversity of his team, composed as it is of hardliners and American Firsters, makes it likely they will argue over what Tehran needs to concede to make a deal worthwhile. That internal division could torpedo the effort to get a deal. All of this raises the question of what happens if talks either do not begin or, perhaps more likely, go nowhere once they do. Calls for the United States to attack Iran s nuclear sites are likely to mount if the maximum pressure campaign does not produce quick results. Trump will also likely hear calls that he should encourage Israel to attack Iran, though Israel lacks the capability to destroy Iran s underground nuclear facilities. Tehran will be assessing Trump s willingness to use military force, as well as Israel s military capabilities, as it thinks about negotiations. Iranian leaders know he ordered the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020, spoke on the campaign trail about blowing Iran to smithereens, and has said that Israel should hit Iran s nuclear sites. But they also know that he campaigned against America s forever wars in the Middle East while boasting, wrongly, that he is the only president in seventy-two years that had no wars. And they have to assess whether efforts by Iranian agents to assassinate Trump, something they have denied, might influence his thinking about military options. Resorting to military force, whether with direct U.S. action or by encouraging Israel to attack, would be a major roll of the dice. It might succeed beyond its planners wildest dreams and usher in a new, more peaceful era in the Middle East. Or, like the invasion of Iraq, it may open a Pandora s Box of problems that will haunt the region and the United States for years to come. But, and this is always worth keeping in mind, letting Iran continue its nuclear and ballistic missile programs while it rebuilds its axis of resistance has costs of its own. So here s to hoping that a return to the maximum pressure strategy works, and we discover that the Trump administration has indeed mastered the art of the deal. What Trump Is Saying Trump is famous for his pugnacious and often uncivil attacks on political opponents. So it is worth noting his respectful comments on the passing of former President Jimmy Carter. Trump first posted his gratitude for Carter s service and extended his condolences to the Carter family. An hour later, he added that Carer had worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect. Meanwhile, Trump s supporters waged a mini-civil war over the weekend on whether to end the H-1B visa program. That is the immigration classification that allows employers who say they cannot fill skilled positions with U.S. workers to hire foreign workers instead. Elon Musk led the chorus of those who favor continuing the program; Steve Bannon led the chorus of those opposed. Trump eventually weighed in Musk s side, saying that H-1B visas are a great program and his properties rely on many H-1B visas to operate. It is unlikely, however, that Trump has made much use of H-1B visas, which are for highly skilled workers, during his business career. He may have confused H-1B visas with H-2B visas, which enable unskilled foreign workers to work legally in the United States. In any event, Trump has not always defended the H-1B visa program. In 2016, he vowed to overhaul if not end the program. He tried but failed during his first term. When pressed on the discrepancy in his views, Trump said: I didn t change my mind. Trump commented on a post by tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, who marveled at a chart showing that tariffs have gone from constituting the primary source of federal revenue to a negligible portion. The incoming president declared that Americans were never so wealthy as when tariffs reigned supreme. No, Americans were not wealthier in the 1890s than they are today. They were decidedly poorer. And higher tariffs will not solve America s deficit and debt woes. The United States simply does not import enough goods for tariffs to generate anywhere near enough revenue to close the annual budget deficit, let alone generate a surplus that will pay down the debt. Stemming the flow of red ink in Washington requires cutting spending and raising income taxes. Full stop. What the Biden Administration Is Doing President Joe Biden announced today that he is blocking Nippon Steel s proposed purchase of U.S. Steel. The decision fell to Biden after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government entity charged with reviewing major foreign investments in the United States, deadlocked on a recommendation. Biden justified his decision on the grounds that we need major U.S. companies representing the major share of US steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America s national interests. Trump said last month that he would also block the deal. The issue will now likely head to the courts. Whatever the outcome of that litigation, Biden s decision has strained U.S. relations with Japan, which is understandably piqued that the United States would see an investment by a close ally as a threat to national security. The Biden administration announced on Monday that Chinese government hackers penetrated computer networks at the Treasury Department. The attacks targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which handles U.S. sanctions on countries and individuals, as well as the Office of the Treasury Secretary. The hackers somehow stole a key used by the vendor that maintains Treasury s cloud-based services and then used the key to override the service s security, remotely access certain Treasury DO [departmental offices] user workstations, and access certain unclassified documents maintained by those users. The Biden administration announced on Monday that it is providing another $2.5 billion in military aid and $3.4 billion in civil and economic aid to Ukraine. This new package exhausts most of the funds that Congress appropriated for Ukraine last April. The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Iranian and Russian entities that it claimed attempted to interfere in the 2024 election. The Iranians reportedly used social engineering techniques to access the computers of people in both parties who had direct access to the presidential campaigns. The Russians reportedly used generative AI to create disinformation that it distributed across websites. The U.S. Navy this week conducted additional air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. The periodic airstrikes, which began last March, have yet to succeed in their goal of ending Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. What the Pundits Are Writing Alina Polyakova argued in Foreign Affairs that Trump needs to first increase the pressure on Russia if he hopes to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. She writes: Trump has said that he aims to pursue a deal with Putin, and he is right to want to bring a lasting and sustainable peace to a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and has destabilized geopolitics around the globe. But to achieve that aim, his administration will first need to get the Russians to the table with a willingness to negotiate and make meaningful compromises that will lead to more than a short-term cease-fire. Newsweek s Tom O Connor summarized ten overseas conflicts that Trump will face when he takes office. The Israel-Gaza and Russia-Ukraine conflicts lead O Connor s list. He concludes that given the potential for some of the most volatile of these ongoing conflicts to directly impact U.S. interests at a time when the nation is engaged in a global great power competition with rivals such as China and Russia, the stakes are high in the second Trump administration's efforts to revamp foreign policy in order to Make America Great Again on the world stage. What the Polls Show Gallup asked Americans to predict how 2025 will go. They were more optimistic about the U.S. economy than U.S. foreign policy. While they see rising stock prices and full employment in the year ahead, they also see a year of rising Chinese and Russian power and an increasing number of international disputes.",Neutral,support,0,0,support
AJJ_Doc4_Canada-Tariffs-Reverseimpact.txt,"Academic rigor , journalistic flair Stewart Prest Lecturer, Political Science, University of British Columbia Languages Portuguese English United States President-elect Donald Trump has reiterated his apparent desire to make Canada a 51st American state, sharing a recent social media post about Canadian entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary s support of the idea. Trump was roundly mocked for his latest trolling of Canada, but his apparent fixation is dangerous at a time when the country s Liberal government, long weakened, is in disarray following the shock resignation of Chrystia Freeland as finance minister and deputy prime minister. In fact, in her December resignation letter, Freeland placed the country s response to Trump at the heart of her critique of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada s wannabe leader and his wife?

Trump wasted no time inserting himself into Canada s internal affairs, calling Freeland toxic and continuing his running gag of referring to Trudeau as the governor of an American state rather than the leader of a sovereign nation. The attacks are becoming routine, with Trump suggesting in another post that Canadians would save massively on taxes and military protection as the 51st state.1/11/25, 5:43 PM Canada s fight with Trump isn t just economic, it s existential 2/7Mercedes S tephenson @MercedesGlobal -Follow President-Elect Donald T rump on Chrystia Freeland s resignation.

He s openly challenging the very idea of Canadian sovereignty. Canada must respond accordingly. It can be hard to fully understand the nature and the extent of threats posed by someone so willing to flout respected political and diplomatic conventions. His annexation threats create a constant set of multifaceted challenges to Canada s economic prosperity, democratic norms and sovereignty. The economic dimension of his threat to Canada is now well-known. Trump s proposed 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian exports to the U.S. are going to be incredibly costly to both countries, given the integration of their economies. But given the size disparity between the two countries, the impact will be bigger in Canada. The democratic threat is also clear. Trump has shown he regards democracy not as a crucial set of rules and norms, but as a set of obstacles to overcome. He s unable to admit defeat or even graciously accept victory. His revenge tour has begun, with lawsuits against media outlets and even against a pollster whose data suggested Democrat Kamala Harris was pulling ahead during the late days of the U.S. election campaign. Once back in the White House, Trump has promised to use public institutions to punish opponents. A partisan U.S. Supreme Court decision last year ensures that even if his own actions are criminal, he will remain immune from prosecution. Trump s disrespect of democratic institutions is corrosive and contagious. During his first term, experts sounded alarm bells about how he was linked to democratic decline around the world. If the U.S. president can openly challenge democratic norms, after all, what s to stop other would-be demagogues from doing the same? A second Trump administration is likely to continue such trends, and his willingness to intervene in Canadian politics is already causing shock waves north of the border.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo)1/11/25, 5:43 PM Canada s fight with Trump isn t just economic, it s existential 4/7A threat to Canadian sovereignty Trump s actions have repeatedly suggested he has no respect for those he views as powerless and right now Canada fits the bill. He s made it a running joke that Canada is not a real country, but just another American state. Nervously laughing off this threat doesn t cut it as a response. Canada has so far acted in a manner that makes it seem as though Trump has a point. Rather than pushing back by defending Canada s strong record in managing its part of the border relationship, the government immediately promised more than $1 billion in new border spending. Canada s leaders have failed to call out Trump s threats as the bluster of a bully. In the face of Trump s tariff threats, Trudeau made a surprise trip to Florida to pay his respects to the president-elect and plead Canada s case, rather than observing the normal protocol and waiting for a formal post-inauguration state visit. This made Trudeau appear more like a supplicant than a visiting head of government. It s helpful in this situation to think of Trump as a schoolyard bully demanding someone else do his homework in this case, defend America s borders. Such bullying doesn t end when you give in to the bully, but only when it becomes clear you won t. Border protection is a core function of any state, and a responsibility of any American president. Trump s demand that others do it for him is both a sign of weakness and an attempt to create a scapegoat should his efforts fail. As with any bully, if you promise to do the work for him, you ll just encourage additional torment. So when Trudeau promised to do more in exchange for an end to the bullying, he got a kick in the pants for his efforts as Trump began to taunt him about being the governor of the 51st American state.

If Canada hopes to enjoy the respect of its peers, it must show a willingness to fight for itself, its prosperity and its values. It must defend its sovereignty from those who refuse to respect it, and act assertively to maintain Canadian prosperity. That could mean a trade war. Power imbalance For more than a century, Canada and the U.S. have found ways to co-operate and prosper side by side despite the fact that the U.S. is a much more powerful nation. They ve built alliances and agreements founded on shared norms, values and customs as part of a deep and multifaceted relationship. Read more: Biden-Trudeau meeting caps two and a half centuries of Canada-U.S. relations None of that history seems to matter to Trump, and now American power seemingly matters more than Canadian sovereignty. This power imbalance is all the more acute given Canada s dependence on the American economy and American military might. But Canada is not powerless. Dependency works both ways, and the deep integration of the two countries economies makes the U.S. vulnerable as well. Shutting off power exports, as Ontario Premier Doug Ford suggests, is one course of action that would have an immediate and significant detrimental effect on the American economy.

Other countries stand to lose if the U.S. gets away with disrespecting Canadian sovereignty as well. If Trump refuses to respect Canadian sovereignty, no country is safe. Panama and Denmark can already attest to that. Finding ways to creatively push back against such demands should be an imperative for any country that values its independence, and Canada needs to work with such allies. Trump will soon be U.S. president again. But he is not and should not be treated as the president of Canada. Whoever leads Canada in the months to come has tools at their disposal to defend Canadian sovereignty, and they must be prepared to use them.1/11/25, 5:43 PM Canada s fight with Trump isn t just economic, it s existential 7/7",Oppose,support,0,0,support
TK_Doc2_Biden-39B-Forgiveness.docx,"More than 800,000 older borrowers will see their federal student debt disappear. Student loan borrowers on income-driven repayment plans who have made 20 or 25 years of payments will get their remaining balances wiped out in coming weeks, the Education Department said. Eligible borrowers will be notified starting Friday. A total of $39 billion will be forgiven as part of a one-time adjustment to loan repayment plans the Biden administration announced last year. Separate from the higher-profile $430 billion program the Supreme Court struck down in late June, this one-time adjustment will give borrowers credit retroactively for months that previously hadn t been counted. Income-driven plans for federal student debt tie monthly payments to a borrower s family size and income and forgive any remaining balances after 20 or 25 years of payments. The Education Department said that inaccurate payment counts in the past resulted in borrowers losing progress toward loan forgiveness. For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said of the adjustment Friday. In this one-time adjustment, some borrowers will move closer to forgiveness and others will see their loans discharged. Some might receive a refund for previous payments, should the adjustment result in a borrower having exceeded the number of months required. Income-driven repayment plans were designed to help low-earning borrowers repay their student loans, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous paperwork, officials said. Borrowers whose loans were in forbearance or deferred due to economic hardships for a time will have those months credited toward their repayment histories. This applies to those with Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loans and who are currently participating in income-driven repayment plans or were previously enrolled in one. The Education Department previously made a similar adjustment to those in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Once these payments are accounted for, borrowers will see their loan balances automatically discharged or reduced in the coming weeks. The adjustment will mainly benefit those who have struggled to make progress on eliminating their debt despite nearly two decades of payments. This is not a fix to anything going forward, said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a nonprofit trade association for student loan servicers. This is a one-time fix where they re counting statuses that were not permitted to be counted in the past. Those currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans or the public-service plan will be able to get credit for partial or late payments. Those who enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan called Saving on Valuable Education, or SAVE, will be able to make much smaller payments and still see that payment count toward forgiveness. Borrowers making under $32,800 a year, or $67,500 for a family, won t owe loan payments. In such cases, those months will still count toward their path to forgiveness. For the millions of borrowers not on income-driven repayment plans and still hoping for forgiveness, the Education Department said the secretary is considering other ways to provide debt relief. After the Supreme Court struck down the previous plan proposed by the Biden administration, President Biden said he would try using a different authority, the Higher Education Act of 1965, to launch a new program.",Neutral,support,0,0,support
PA_Doc4_Student-Loans-Trump.docx,"What You Need to Know About Student Loans Before Trump Takes Office Jan. 20 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office January 20, many Americans across the country are wondering what this will mean for their student loans. President Joe Biden ushered in student loan forgiveness for millions during his presidency, but a new Trump presidency has many borrowers concerned about how their debt could change in 2025. Trump's own for-profit college, Trump University, was hit with a lawsuit alleging fraud. It ended with a $25 million settlement to those who attended the now defunct school. How Will Student Loans Change When Trump Takes Office? Based on Trump's track record, student loan borrowers are unlikely to see any more relief under the new administration. During his first term, his administration pushed for monthly payments to increase from 10 to 12.5 percent of borrowers' discretionary income and also sought to merge all income-driven repayment plans into one simplified option. In his second term, these moves could come up again. Will Biden's SAVE Plan Stay in Place? During Biden's presidency, he introduced a Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan that cut down payments for millions and even led to student loan forgiveness for some. The income-based plan reduced many borrowers' monthly payments to zero, saved other borrowers around $1,000 per year and prevented balances from growing because of unpaid interest. ""President Trump signaled opposition to these programs on the campaign trail, so the likelihood of them suddenly gaining support seems virtually nonexistent. If you haven't been treating your student debt seriously in the hope of future forgiveness, now is the time to start tackling it by making payments,"" Beene said. What Happens Next Thompson said borrowers should prepare for the likelihood that all student loan debt will be expected to be repaid under Trump's administration. ""Unless the Biden administration pushes through last-minute executive action for additional loan forgiveness, the likelihood of widespread relief under Trump is low,"" he said. ""His previous term rolled back consumer protections and shifted student loan policies toward a more rigid framework. The expectation will likely be that borrowers repay their loans in full, reinforcing the principle of caveat emptor buyer beware."" Borrowers should look into refinancing and consolidation options. ""Interest rates, repayment structures and federal protections could change under a new administration, and borrowers will need to be proactive in managing their financial future,"" Thompson said. ""If you're holding out for student loan forgiveness, it may be time to rethink your strategy. Under Trump, the focus will likely be on repayment enforcement rather than relief.""",Oppose,oppose,1,0,support
TK_Doc3_Biden-Loan-Halted.docx,"WASHINGTON A federal appeals court Friday temporarily stopped the Biden administration from moving forward with its plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student-loan debt for millions of Americans. The Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the halt in a one-page order that will remain in place for a short period while it considers a request by Republican leaders in six states to block implementation of the program. The Biden administration has said in court filings that it wouldn t discharge any student-loan debt before Oct. 23. The appeals court order at least pushes back that start date a few days, though White House officials have said it could take weeks to process the bulk of the applications. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that the order doesn t prevent borrowers from applying for the program or the administration from reviewing applications. We will continue to move full speed ahead in our preparations in compliance with this order, Ms. Jean-Pierre said. And the administration will continue to fight Republican officials suing to block our efforts to provide relief to working families, she added. It s very important that the legal issues involving presidential power be analyzed by the court before transferring over $400 billion in debt to American taxpayers, said Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, who is part of the appeal. The Biden administration estimates the debt relief would cost $379 billion over 30 years, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a similar estimate of around $400 billion that assumed 90% of eligible borrowers would apply. Friday s decision by the appeals court comes one day after a federal judge in Missouri denied a request by the group of Republican state leaders to block the program. The appeals court, which is hearing an appeal of the Missouri judge s order, set a briefing schedule with deadlines early next week. The development comes just hours after President Biden touted his efforts to forgive student loans during a speech at a Delaware university on Friday. Mr. Biden praised the Thursday ruling and pointed to a separate move by the Supreme Court to deny an emergency appeal to block implementation of the program brought by a group of Wisconsin taxpayers. The courts, the president argued earlier Friday, had sent a message: We re on Biden s side. The administration on Monday began accepting applications for loan forgiveness through an online portal that requires applicants to provide only basic information such as their legal names, Social Security numbers and email addresses. Officials have said it would take several weeks to process the applications. Some applicants will be asked for additional information to verify their incomes. So far, nearly 22 million borrowers have applied for forgiveness through the program, Mr. Biden said. The site hasn t experienced any major technical issues, according to administration officials and analysts tracking the issue. The Education Department has begun informing some borrowers that they don t need to apply for the program because the department already has enough information about their loans to process their forgiveness. In emails to borrowers who don t need to apply, the department said they have the right to opt out of the program if, for example, they are concerned about having to pay state taxes on the debt that is forgiven. Those borrowers have until Nov. 14 to alert their loan servicers that they are opting out of the program, according to the department emails. The administration has estimated that roughly eight million people fall into this category.",Neutral,oppose,1,0,support
GKF_Doc2_Trump-Floats-Using.docx,"Trump Floats Using Force to Take Greenland and the Panama Canal In an hourlong news conference at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect delivered a hodgepodge of grievances, complaints and false claims. President-elect Donald J. Trump refused on Tuesday to rule out the use of military or economic coercion to force Panama to give up control of the canal that America built more than a century ago and to push Denmark to sell Greenland to the United States. In a rambling, hourlong news conference, Mr. Trump repeatedly returned to the theme of American sacrifice in building the canal and accused China, falsely, of operating it today. When pressed on the question of whether he might order the military to force Panama to give it up in violation of treaties and other agreements reached during the Carter administration or to do the same with Greenland, he said: No, I can t assure you on either of those two. We need them for economic security the Panama Canal was built for our military, he said. Asked again if he would rule out the use of military force, he said: I m not going to commit to that. You might have to do something. Mr. Trump s statements propelled his repeated calls for expanding American territory to a new level, one that is bound to roil three American allies Panama; Denmark, which handles Greenland s foreign and security affairs; and Canada, which he has mocked as America s 51st State. On Tuesday he made clear, though, that he was not joking, suggesting that if Canada remained a sovereign state the financial cost to its trading relationship with the United States could be crushing. Perhaps Mr. Trump was posturing, for negotiating advantage. Yet not since the days of William McKinley, who engaged in the Spanish-American War in the late 19th century and ended up with U.S. control of the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico, has an American president-elect so blatantly threatened the use of force to expand the country s territorial boundaries. It was a reminder that Mr. Trump s definition of America First is anything but isolationist. He comes to American foreign policy with the mind of a real estate developer, with a penchant for grabbing territory. He insisted he would not be deterred by the treaty signed with Panama, which was ratified by the Senate in 1978 by 68 to 32, just beyond the two-thirds vote required by the constitution. He asserted that the return of control of the Canal to Panama was a bad idea arguing that he was reluctant to say so while the nation was burying former President Jimmy Carter, who negotiated the deal. He then returned, repeatedly, to criticizing Mr. Carter s judgment. He was a very fine person, Mr. Trump said. But that was a big mistake, he added. It cost us the equivalent of a trillion dollars. On Canada, Mr. Trump, when pressed, threatened to use economic force, not the military, to join Canada and the United States together, implying that the United States would pare back its purchases of Canadian products. He declared he would use tariffs to hamper Canada s ability to assemble cars and sell them in the United States, and then charged that Canada contributed insufficiently to American defenses. He made no reference to NORAD, the combined American and Canadian defensive effort that is considered a military model for an interoperable, joint military early-warning system, run equally by two allies. It is at the core of American air and missile defense. He continued his push on Tuesday evening, posting maps on social media showing Canada as part of the United States. He also said at the news conference that he would tariff Denmark at a very high level if it did not give Greenland to the United States, before casting doubt on whether Denmark has a legitimate claim to Greenland at all. The threats, vague and unformed as they may be, were only part of the series of declarations Mr. Trump made about his plans when he takes office in less than two weeks. He said the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America, though it was unclear how serious he was about the effort. He declared that members of NATO, who were slow to fulfill a commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, should now prepare for a world in which they needed to spend 5 percent. They can all afford it, but they should be at 5 percent, not 2 percent, he said, before again threatening to not defend any NATO ally who did not, in his view, pay into the system sufficiently. Mr. Putin has used such threats in the past to sow divisions within NATO, an alliance he has been loath to take on directly even as it helps arm Ukraine. Mr. Trump s critique of NATO isn t a solitary one: Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Biden have all pressed the case, and the most progress in meeting the 2 percent goal has come in Mr. Biden s term, a fact he celebrated at the NATO summit in Washington in July during the 75th anniversary of the alliance. And even some European leaders, when speaking privately, say they agree that the goal should be moved to 3 percent if Europe is going to have any hope of assembling the military might to deter Russia in coming decades. They often add that there is no political constituency for spending at that level. But they may be driven there by necessity if they become convinced that the United States will not come to their aid. I would have loved to say yes, we ll protect you even if you don t pay, but that not the way life works, Mr. Trump told reporters. Mr. Trump also reiterated his threat that all hell will break out in the Middle East if the hostages being held by Hamas are not released by Inauguration Day, repeating the threat four times. But it was Mr. Trump s views on American territorial expansionism that were most striking in the news conference, and so untethered from international law. Image In December, when Mr. Trump ramped up his calls for the purchase of Greenland and voiced his complaints about how American shipping was treated as it traversed the Panama Canal, Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group noted that the case Mr. Trump was making had echoes of the justifications President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia made for invading Ukraine. But piecing together Mr. Trump s series of social media posts on these issues, and hearing his complaints at his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, one thing is clear: He is building a national security case for why an American takeover of Greenland and the Panama Canal Zone is necessary. He noted on Tuesday that Chinese and Russian ships were appearing around Greenland, an apparent showing of the countries growing interest in shorter polar shipping and military routes after global warming loosened and shrank ice fields, making them more passable. He argued that China, which controls two ports near the canal, was operating the canal itself; it is not. After Mr. Trump responded to the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday by writing on social media that many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State, Mr. Bremmer noted in a post on X that American imperialism is so back. In fact, it often sounded that way at the news conference, as Mr. Trump dismissed the declarations of Denmark s leadership that Greenland is not up for sale, and similar comments from Panama. The only question now is whether he is increasing the pressure for negotiating purposes, or would actually make good on his threats.",Oppose,oppose,1,0,support
NC_Doc4.docx,"Biden s Biggest Foreign Policy Legacy Will Be in Economic Warfare His administration has pushed back harder against rivals and adversaries such as China and Russia, and done so with more potent tools. November 3, 2024 at 7:00 AM CST By Hal Brands Joe Biden s foreign policy will be remembered for many things: the humiliating exit from Afghanistan, the stalwart response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the struggle to contain the fallout from Oct. 7 in the Middle East. But Biden has cast his longest shadow by shaping a new era of economic warfare likely to intensify in the years ahead. Economic warfare has figured in great competitions and conflicts since the ancient age. As every reader of Thucydides knows, the Megarian Decree a trade embargo imposed by Athens was a signpost on the road to the Peloponnesian War. In 1941, a US oil embargo against Japan helped to trigger the attack on Pearl Harbor and globalize World War II. During the Cold War, the free world contained the Soviet Union in economic as well as military terms. After the Cold War, the US mostly used sanctions against rogue states and terrorist groups, while hoping that economic integration could lead to great-power peace. But amid escalating geopolitical rivalries, first Donald Trump and now, more systematically, Joe Biden, have increasingly wielded economic weapons. After Vladimir Putin s invasion of Ukraine, the US and its allies blitzed Russia with a stunning array of sanctions. Biden s China strategy has featured domestic investments to keep the US ahead in key sectors of the 21st century economy and targeted restrictions, from investment curbs to export controls, to keep Beijing from catching up. These measures are reshaping the global economy. They can serve to avert devastating military conflicts or to prepare for them. And this contest is hardly a one-way affair: Autocratic powers, namely China, are racing to blunt the impact of Western sanctions even as they sharpen their own economic knives for the long struggles ahead. So, navigating this new era will require learning 10 lessons from the Biden years. First, economic warfare is back for a very old reason: Economic strength is the wellspring of global power. A country s military prowess reflects its economy s heft and dynamism. Even in peacetime, economic influence helps to win friends and punish enemies. As strategic competition sharpens, economic rivalry becomes a cut-throat business. For a generation after 1989, America had no real competitors. Even as the US sanctioned tin-pot dictators and lethal terrorists, it sought to draw potential great-power rivals into the global economy in hopes of making them satisfied members of an American-led world. It didn t work out as planned. Russia used access to the international economy, as well as the post-2001 oil boom, to rebuild its military. It cultivated European dependence on Russian energy, in hopes of neutralizing resistance to its own broader ambitions. China s access to foreign markets enabled a decades-long, export-driven boom and a record-shattering, increasingly disruptive military buildup. Beijing also made a mercantilist push to dominate industries both old (e.g., steel) and new (e.g., advanced telecommunications). China and Russia were using economic statecraft to weaken the very system that had assisted their rise. Now, the US is pushing back harder, and with more potent tools. This relates to a second lesson, which is that the toolkit has expanded, and its tools have become sharper. My Johns Hopkins colleague Adam Szubin makes this point and he would know, having been a top Treasury official in the Obama years. Traditionally, economic warfare featured blockades and trade embargoes. These measures were potentially powerful, but also difficult and costly to impose. If Britain wanted to crush Napoleonic France, for instance, it had to physically blockade Europe and even then, the results were disappointing. Over the past quarter-century, however, the US has honed a sharper, more targeted set of sanctions that exploit its control of chokepoints in the global economy. They inflict outsized damage on an adversary by barring it from key sources of innovation and prosperity in the modern world. Biden s team didn t invent these tools, many of which emerged in earlier fights against Iran, North Korea and al Qaeda. But it did refine them and apply them more extensively especially against great-power rivals than any prior administration. History will record that the US-China tech war began in earnest in October 2022. That s when Biden rolled out far-reaching export controls that used the primacy of the dollar in global finance, as well as America s role in a specific supply chain (designing high-end semiconductors), to curtail China s access to the advanced chips that power economic and military innovation. Under Trump, Washington had used those tools to target a single company, Huawei. Biden expanded the restrictions to target China as a whole. This strategy built on what the US had done earlier to Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, exploiting the centrality of the dollar, and America s influence in key financial messaging systems, to disconnect Russian banks from the world. Washington cut off Russia s access to the most sophisticated semiconductors a preview of what would soon happen to China. The US and its allies also used their financial dominance to freeze Russia s huge foreign reserve holdings and their preeminence in maritime insurance markets and other crucial services to cap the price of oil that Russia exports to the globe. No one could have predicted the severity of those sanctions, Russia s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. In the world s two most important rivalries, Biden has aggressively and creatively wielded America s asymmetric economic advantages. He has also subtly shifted the purpose of those sanctions. Indeed, a third lesson is that attrition is displacing coercion. The point of modern economic warfare is more often to weaken an opponent s capabilities than to change his mind. That hasn t always been the case. For decades, the US viewed sanctions primarily as tools to modify weaker adversaries behavior to persuade Iran, for instance, to negotiate a nuclear deal. Even the tariffs Trump slapped on China were intended to change Beijing s approach to development and trade. Yet Biden s strategy has often had a different aim. Almost no one expected the sanctions imposed on Russia in February 2022 and after whether tech restrictions or Germany s cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline to compel Putin s withdrawal from Ukraine. The goal was merely to weaken a dangerous rival in a protracted struggle to impair their ability to compete, as Biden explained. Similarly, Biden didn t make any specific asks of Beijing when he imposed semiconductor curbs or restricted US investment in China s high-tech sector. That s because these sanctions are strategic, not transactional: Their primary purpose is to hinder China s innovation in areas essential to economic and military power. Coercive sanctions persist: Biden threatened China with harsh penalties if it exported weapons to Russia in 2022-23. But since America probably can t fundamentally change the behavior of its rivals, keeping them behind will have to be good enough. Doing so requires heeding a fourth lesson: Building up one s own capabilities is as important as holding down those of the other side. The counterpart to Biden s chip curbs on China was his administration s investment in expanded domestic chip production. Biden s tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and his subsidies to bolster America s EV industry, are two sides of the same coin. Granted, industrial policy s track record is uneven and as the international reaction to the Inflation Reduction Act shows, protectionism can annoy America s friends. But the measures America has used to prevent rivals from ruling key supply chains will only buy time unless they are paired with a more positive agenda in the US and the larger democratic world. Thus, a fifth lesson: Even a superpower needs lots of help. America has an unmatched ability to squeeze its competitors. But effective economic warfare work still entails bringing allies along. Freezing Russia s foreign reserves required the cooperation of the European countries in which Putin had stashed so much of his loot. Enforcing semiconductor controls requires working with countries Taiwan, Japan, the Netherlands, and others that make advanced chips and the equipment used to manufacture them. Starving China s high-tech industries of foreign capital will be much easier if allies in Europe and Asia join the fight. America s financial power and alliance networks give it leverage: It s hard for Taiwan or Japan to tell their primary security partner to take a hike. But the process isn t always pretty. The run-up to the Ukraine war saw protracted transatlantic wrangling over how harshly to penalize a Russian invasion. Securing Japanese and Dutch collaboration on semiconductor curbs was (and remains) a fraught endeavor. The Biden team has tried to win cooperation through engagement and persuasion with the implicit threat that it might just use the same sanctions to compel allies if they don t play ball. No matter how targeted, sanctions inflict pain on the countries that impose them; not every democracy sees the world as America might like. Economic warfare is waged against one s enemies; it also requires some rough bargaining with one s friends. Sixth, economic warfare can be a substitute for military warfare or a means of waging it. The appeal of sanctions is that they allow Washington to jostle for advantage without getting into a physical fight. That s especially important given that conflict with China or Russia could lead, as Biden has said, to World War III. But the line between military and economic issues isn t always bright and clear. One reason the US is so concerned about China s access to high-end semiconductors is that those chips could end up in Beijing s nuclear arsenal or other military capabilities. And one reason Washington triggered those curbs in October 2022 was that a high-profile crisis over Taiwan two months earlier had raised concerns that America and China might be headed for a shooting war. If Washington and Beijing do end up in a more dangerous Taiwan crisis, the US might threaten to employ stronger trade, tech and financial sanctions to deter a Chinese attack or ratchet up the price it incurs. Economic statecraft isn t just some enlightened alternative to military conflict; it is a way of shaping the battlefield in intense, bloody fights. Seventh, economic warfare is powerful, but it s not a wonder weapon. Just look at what sanctions have and haven t achieved against Russia. Sanctions have strained Russia s finances, restricted its access to Western technology and caused deep economic imbalances. But contrary to some premature crowing by Biden, sanctions haven t brought that economy crashing down. Russia continues to find large sums for defense; its war industries are churning out tanks and shells. Its ability to do both tells us a lot about the limits of modern economic warfare. A Russia isolated by the West pivoted toward trade with the East, especially China. Moscow rapidly learned the art of sanctions evasion just witness how much Western tech still ends up in Russian arms with assists from Beijing and Tehran. It skirted the oil price cap by building a shadow fleet of tankers that carries illicit crude. Not least, Russia benefitted from Western skittishness. The US and its allies tried to limit the price Putin gets for his oil. But they haven t really tried to remove it from the global market, by aggressively sanctioning its buyers, for fear of roiling relations with swing states such as India and causing widespread economic disruptions. The implications for a Taiwan crisis are worth pondering. Perhaps, as some US analysts hope, a sanctions blitz will bring China to its knees. Or perhaps greater interdependence between the US and China will simply make it too hard to blast Beijing without causing ghastly collateral damage. And surely a key lesson of the Ukraine war is that strangling a major power isn t easy especially if that country is preparing for the assault. An eighth lesson is that America s tactics are inspiring insulation and imitation. US adversaries, principally China, are trying to protect themselves from economic pressure while developing economic arsenals of their own. Beijing is hoarding fuel, food and other commodities that could be cut off in a crisis. It is building a payment system to get around the Western-dominated SWIFT and striving for technological self-reliance to blunt US export controls. Meanwhile, the autocratic quartet China, Russia, Iran and North Korea is developing geographically protected trade routes to foster a Eurasian economic bloc that is beyond America s wrath. China isn t just playing defense. In recent years, Beijing has restricted trade and tourism with South Korea, Australia, Lithuania and other disobedient democracies. It has announced (largely symbolic) restrictions on the export of key minerals. Now, China is assembling a larger arsenal of export controls, asset freezes, financial restrictions, and many of the same measures Washington uses, so it can deter the use of foreign sanctions or take the offensive against its enemies. China s toolkit still doesn t rival America s: That s a key reason Beijing has refrained from responding too strongly to Biden s tech squeeze. But China is preparing for the future because it doesn t want economic warfare to be a one-way street. Of course, bad actors aren t the only ones that worry about the reach of US sanctions. Friendlier countries also fear that the US might turn the same tools against them someday. A ninth lesson, then, is that the danger of overuse is real, even if the damage is still mostly hypothetical. India, for instance, may be the biggest winner from Western sanctions against Russia, which have allowed it to buy oceans of Putin s oil at bargain prices. But it simultaneously wants to ensure, as Fareed Zakaria has reported, that America could never do to India what it has just done to Russia. It s a common sentiment. As US sanctions have skyrocketed, more countries are looking to limit their vulnerability. A BRICS summit last month buzzed with talk of de-dollarization. During the Trump years, even close allies in Europe experimented with alternative financial mechanisms meant to evade US influence. The barriers to diversification are high because the dollar remains ubiquitous in global finance. De-dollarization is still more of a catch-phrase than a reality. But the more aggressively the US uses sanctions, the more it risks undermining the advantages, and alienating the allies, that make them so potent in the first place. That s worth remembering, in view of a final lesson: The new age of economic warfare is only beginning. The US and China are playing a cat-and-mouse game in which Beijing tries to evade one set of sanctions, causing the US to adapt and tighten them. And while Washington has moved against Beijing on the most advanced chips, another battle to ensure China doesn t dominate production of widely used legacy chips now looms. Moreover, a whole suite of new technologies chips, quantum computing, AI, advanced robotics, synthetic biology will shape the global economy. The campaigns for supremacy in these areas are now unfolding. For all the Biden team s declarations that it is pursuing a small yard, high fence strategy to safeguard US technological advantages, the yard just keeps getting bigger. The next president, in fact, will surely reach for the same weapons Biden has wielded. If Donald Trump is elected, America will have an economically pugilistic president who if his first term is any guide will pressure allies as well as enemies in the quest for US advantage. If Kamala Harris prevails, she may persist with the more targeted, multilateral approach she inherited from Biden. Even so, she will likely expand the use of these economic tools, as US-Russia tensions remain high and deteriorating US-China relations turn points of interaction into vectors for vulnerability. Today, economic statecraft is at the very core of the struggle for global power and influence. That won t change, no matter how the coming election turns out.",Support,support,0,0,support
TK_Doc1_Student-Loan-Cancellation.docx,"Nearly four million borrowers have had about $138 billion of their federal student loans flagged for cancellation, despite a Supreme Court ruling last June that blocked relief for millions more student-loan holders. The high court ruled that the Biden administration couldn t cancel hundreds of billions of dollars for tens millions of student-loan holders, reasoning that the authority for such a broad-based policy doesn t exist under the law. While that closed one path, Biden tapped a variety of different tools that no previous president had ever used to this extent. The administration announced its latest round of cancellations on Feb. 21, forgiving about $1.2 billion in loans for roughly 153,000 borrowers. Since taking office in 2021, the Biden administration has arranged to cancel loans equal to around a third of the total projected cost of its blocked mass cancellation plan. Here s how: Around 40 million people owe nearly $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt. Biden sought to cancel $430 billion of it through a blanket forgiveness plan announced in August 2022. The Supreme Court blocked that strategy in June. Using existing tools, the administration has cobbled together batches of forgiven loans that now total around $137.8 billion. The amount equals about a third of the total cost of the mass cancellation plan. Using anti-fraud and consumer protection regulations, the administration has forgiven $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who say they were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions close suddenly or are covered by related court settlements. Many of these borrower defense claims had languished for years. The administration whittled down the backlog through approvals and settlements. A revamped application process has led to $11.7 billion forgiven for 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. Waivers and tweaked rules for public-service loan forgiveness, a program dating to 2007, have led to almost $56.7 billion in forgiveness for 793,400 public servants since 2021. The Biden administration has said income-driven repayment programs have been troubled by inaccuracies for decades. Addressing those issues allowed it to forgive nearly $45.7 billion for almost 930,500 borrowers. The 153,000 borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan received $1.2 billion in forgiveness ahead of schedule. Borrowers owed less than $12,000 and had been making payments for ten years. Not all of the $138 billion in relief has been fully processed by the Education Department and loan servicers, creating confusion for borrowers who must now figure out whether they still have outstanding student loan debt. That issue has become more pressing since payments and interest accrual restarted in 2023 after a pandemic-era freeze that lasted more than three years. While the tools the administration is using in its piecemeal cancellation strategy have a long history of passing legal muster, they still run some risk of getting tied up in court. In August, a federal court in New Orleans froze the administration s expansion of borrower defense the tool for students who think they have been misled by their schools leaving its future prospects unclear.",Support,oppose,1,0,support
SKSK_Doc2_ Biden-Lowers-Prescription-Drug.txt," FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health Care, and Protect Consumers The President believes that health care is a right, not a privilege, and since day one, he has delivered health care to millions more Americans while also lowering health care costs. The President continues to build on, strengthen, and protect Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act, signing laws such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to lower prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums. Thanks to the President s efforts, more Americans have health insurance than under any other President, and are better protected against surprise medical bills and junk fees. Seniors are already seeing lower prescription drug prices with insulin capped at $35, free vaccines, and out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs capped at $2,000 starting in 2025. And the Administration is well on its way to lower the cost of range of drugs as Medicare negotiates over the prices of prescription drugs for the first time ever. The Biden-Harris Administration has also taken steps to make sure consumers aren t scammed by junk insurance and have better access to mental health care. However, the President is not just resting on these accomplishments. He s f ighting to deliver even lower costs and better health care to Americans. That s why the Biden-Harris Administration is acting to lower prescription drug costs, keep health insurance premiums low, expand access to health care, especially mental health care coverage, and continue to protect Americans from getting ripped off. Taking on Big Pharma to Deliver Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors and Families After decades of opposition, President Biden enacted a law that finally takes on Big Pharma and gives Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. President Biden s Inflation Reduction Act will save millions of seniors money on some of the costliest prescription drugs on the market. Meanwhile, Big 1/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... Pharma also executed over $135 billion in mergers and acquisitions in 2023 alone, while passing the cost to consumers. And eight of the 10 drugs selected for this year s negotiation program raised their prices drugs were already priced in 2024 after all 10 three to eight times higher in the United States than in other countries. President Biden knows how the Inflation Reduction Act is delivering for American families, and his Administration will continue the fight to lower health care costs for more Americans. Announcing that Manufacturers of 10 Drugs Remain at the Negotiating Table. Last month, for the first time in history, Medicare has made offers on the fair price for 10 of the most widely used and expensive drugs. Medicare is no longer taking whatever price for these drugs that the pharmaceutical companies demand. This week CMS announced that manufacturers for all 10 selected drugs are participating in drug price negotiation, with all manufacturers having submitted counteroffers and negotiations continuing. Later this year, new, negotiated prices for the first 10 prescription drugs selected for the negotiation program will be announced. Let Medicare Negotiate Drug Prices for at least 50 Drugs Every Year. Medicare should not be limited to negotiating just 20 drugs per year. Instead, the President is proposing that Medicare be able to negotiate prices for the major drugs that seniors rely on, like those used for treating heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. The Budget cuts federal spending by $200 billion increasing the number of drugs Medicare can select for negotiation and bringing more drugs into the negotiation process sooner, and other reforms. Expand Cap on Out-of-Pocket Prescription Drug Costs. When the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs applies in Medicare in 2025, nearly 19 million seniors and other beneficiaries are projected to save $400 per year on prescription drugs. The President is calling on Congress to expand the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap to all private insurance so that all Americans have the peace of mind that comes with knowing that they won t have to choose between filling their prescription or putting food on the table. Capping Medicare Cost-Sharing at $2 for Common Generic Drugs. Medicare will be launching a new model to limit Medicare Part D cost sharing for certain generic drugs to $2. As Medicare prepares to launch the model, HHS will publish a list of dozens of generic drugs for the model, including drugs like statins to treat high cholesterol, beta 2/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... blockers for high blood pressure, and platelet inhibitors to prevent blood clots. In his budget, the President is calling on Congress to limit Medicare cost-sharing to $2 for high-value generic drugs for all Medicare plans. Access to Cell & Gene Therapies. In January, HHS announced that sickle cell disease will be the first focus of the Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) Access Model. Under this model, CMS will negotiate with manufacturers on behalf of state Medicaid programs to increase affordable access to potentially lifesaving and life-changing treatment, and lower health care costs for some of the nation s most vulnerable populations. CMS will release the Request for Applications for drug manufacturers of cell and gene therapies to participate in the model. Expand the IRA s Requirement that Drug Companies Pay Rebates When They Increase Prices Faster than Inflation. Thanks to the IRA, drug manufacturers must now pay rebates to Medicare if their price increases for certain drugs exceed inflation. The President is calling on Congress to require those rebates for commercial drug sales, as well as sales to Medicare. That will save the federal government billions of dollars, further curb prescription drug price inflation, and reduce health insurance premiums for people with private health insurance coverage. Putting High-Quality Health Care Within Reach Today, more Americans have health insurance than under any President. The President s efforts to lower health insurance premiums have led to record breaking enrollment in the Affordable Care Act s Marketplaces, with over 21 million people signing up for coverage 9 million more than when the President took office. The Biden-Harris Administration isn t stopping there and is building on this incredible success by: Keeping Health Insurance Premiums Low. Thanks to the President s American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act, millions of Americans are saving on average $800 a year on premiums. The Biden Harris Administration is committed to keeping health insurance premiums low, giving families more breathing room and the peace of mind that health insurance brings. To do that, the President is calling on Congress to make the expanded premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act extended permanent. Without Congressional action, millions of Americans will see their health insurance premiums spike by hundreds or thousands of dollars starting in the fall of 2025. 3/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... Closing the Medicaid Coverage Gap. The President continues to call on Congress to provide Medicaid-like coverage to people in the 10 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion as well as keeping Medicaid expansion enrollees covered. Keeping Kids Covered. Investing in our nation s children is a top priority for the President. Research shows that when children have health insurance, they thrive: they re healthier, they do better in school, and are more likely to succeed in adulthood. Keeping children covered is the right thing to do, which is why the President wants to make sure that children can never lose coverage due to red tape from birth until they turn age 6, and that families only have to submit Medicaid paperwork once every three years. Closing Research Gaps in Women s Health Research. In November 2023, the President and the First Lady launched the first-ever White House Initiative on Women s Health Research to fundamentally change how our nation approaches and funds women s health research. Women make up more than half the population but have been understudied and underrepresented in health research for far too long. Tonight, the President is calling on Congress to make a bold, transformative investment of $12 billion in new funding for women s health research. These investments will support a new fund at the National Institutes of Health to advance an interdisciplinary research agenda and create a new nationwide network of research centers of excellence and innovation in women s health. The Initiative will also catalyze private and philanthropic commitments to increase funding for women s health research. These new resources will make investments that maximize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women and ensure women get the answers they need when it comes to their health. Making Home Care More Available. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, President Biden delivered $37 billion to all states to expand access to home care and improve the quality of caregiving jobs. The Biden Harris Administration is taking steps to improve the quality of Medicaid home care services and to make sure home care workers get a bigger share of Medicaid payments for these critical services. The President remains committed to further improving and expanding Medicaid home care services, and is calling on Congress to do their part to allow the hundreds of thousands of older adults and individuals with disabilities on Medicaid home care waiting list to remain in their homes and stay 4/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... active in their communities while continuing to improve the quality of jobs for caregivers. Ensuring Access to Mental Health Care. Ensuring robust access to mental health care has been a bipartisan priority for almost 15 years, including the enactment of mental health parity requirements which require health plans to cover mental health care benefits at the same levels as physical health care benefits. Yet today, too many Americans still struggle to find and afford the care they need. The President is committed to tackling the mental health crisis in this country, which means making health plans do their part and providing agencies with the needed support to make sure they re doing so. The Biden-Harris Administration is working to finalize the mental health parity rule, which would close existing loopholes as well as ensure health plans evaluate access to mental health care in their networks, and make changes if it s found to be inadequate. In addition, the President is calling on Congress to further increase access to mental health care by expanding coverage in Medicare and private insurance, applying the mental health parity requirements to Medicare beneficiaries, and extending Medicare incentive programs to address mental health provider shortages. Cracking Down on Junk Insurance, Surprise Bills and Fees, and Confusing Health Care Pricing Nothing infuriates the President more than seeing Americans get ripped off. That s why the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized implementing surprise billing protections, preventing 1 million Americans from receiving surprise medical bills every single month. The President has also taken steps to prevent Americans from being ripped off by junk insurance that preys on vulnerable citizens by closing loopholes to ensure consumers know what they re buying and can get the health coverage that best meets their needs. But more can be done to protect consumers, which is why the President intends to: Prevent More Surprise Medical Bills. Today, Americans are protected from receiving medical bills for most emergency care and air ambulance services as well as when consumers didn t know they were getting care from an out-of-network provider despite doing their homework and going to an in-network facility for treatment. The President wants to further protect consumers by applying surprise billing protections to 5/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... ground ambulance providers. The last thing people should worry about during an emergency is an unexpected bill for their ambulance ride. Crack Down on Junk Insurance. Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration proposed a monumental rule to help millions of Americans access high-quality, affordable health insurance and protect consumers from being discriminated against because of pre-existing conditions. Making sure Americans aren t scammed into low-quality coverage, and charged more or denied life-saving care is a key priority for the Administration, which is why we are working to finalize proposed rules that limit the availability of junk insurance. Honoring America s Commitment to Seniors The President has always believed that Medicare and Social Security are a promise a rock-solid guarantee generations of Americans have counted on to be able to retire with dignity and security. The President will reject any efforts to cut the Medicare or Social Security benefits that seniors and people with disabilities have earned and paid into their entire working lives. The Budget honors that ironclad commitment not only by rejecting benefit cuts, but by embracing reforms and investments that will protect and strengthen both programs. The President is committed to working with Congress to ensure Medicare and Social Security remain strong for their beneficiaries, now and in the future. Securing Medicare. In his budget, the President is calling on Congress to ensure that high-income individuals contribute their fair share to Medicare and directs revenue from the Net Investment Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was originally intended. In addition, the President has proposed to direct savings from further lowering drug costs into the Medicare trust fund. If Congress were to heed the President s call and enact these reforms, it would substantially extend solvency for the Medicare HI Trust Fund, guaranteeing seniors the benefits they have been promised. Protects Seniors Health and Dignity. As President Biden pledged to do two years ago in the State of the Union, the Biden-Harris Administration is set[ting] higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect. The nursing home industry receives billions of dollars of taxpayer funding each year, but for too long, many facilities have not had the staff required to give residents safe, high-quality care.

The final rule was just submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review Strong Record on Expanding and Strengthening Health Care Nationwide The President s new actions are all in addition to an already impressive track record on fighting for the health care of Americans across the nation. Over the last three years, the President has: Expanded health insurance through the ACA Marketplaces to an additional nine million Americans and helped over one million people in Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Dakota gain Medicaid coverage. Extended postpartum Medicaid coverage to nearly 700,000 women across 44 states and the District of Columbia. Kept children covered continuously in Medicaid and CHIP for a full year. Made it easier for people to enroll in the ACA Marketplaces and Medicaid, including for older adults that are covered by both Medicaid and Medicare. Made critical vaccines free for all Medicare beneficiaries as well as adults enrolled in Medicaid, with seniors on Medicare saving on average $70 in out-of-pockets for vaccines. Lowered maximum out of pocket costs for Americans with employer and ACA coverage by an average of $400. Capped out-of-pocket costs at $35 for a month s supply of insulin for seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare.

GDR_Doc3_Quantum_Centers.txt," Title: Trump Administration Establishes $75 Million Quantum Computing Centers Authors: Maggie Miller Source/Date: The Hill, July 2020 URL: Keywords: Quantum Computing, Research Centers, Trump Administration, National Science Foundation, Investment Summary: In a major initiative to advance quantum technology, the Trump administration has announced the establishment of three new quantum computing research centers with a combined investment of $75 million. These centers, funded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal agencies, aim to position the United States as a global leader in quantum research and development. Each center will focus on specific aspects of quantum technology, including quantum communication, quantum sensing, and quantum computing hardware. These areas are seen as critical for achieving breakthroughs that can revolutionize fields such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. The centers are also designed to foster collaboration among academia, industry, and government, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for innovation. The initiative aligns with the National Quantum Initiative Act, which was signed into law in 2018 to provide a coordinated approach to quantum research across federal agencies. By investing in these research centers, the Trump administration seeks to accelerate the development of practical quantum applications that can benefit both the public and private sectors. Workforce development is a key component of the initiative.

HKK_Doc3_Biden-Funded-New.txt,"Biden funded new factories and infrastructure projects, but Trump might get to cut the ribbons All that's left is for President-elect Donald Trump to put his name on it if he wants. Trump won the White House in large part because of voters' frustration with high prices and a sense that the United States needs major changes. But when he enters office in January, Trump will inherit an economy primed for growth. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is easing and President Joe Biden's administration has teed-up a ready-made list of infrastructure projects that could go from theoretical to reality over the next several years. There s the TSMC computer chip plant in Arizona, the new Hyundai electric vehicle factory in Georgia and a modernized I-375 in Michigan, among thousands of projects under way that will take years to complete. All of that means it could be Trump, rather than Biden, who gets to tell Americans that he built the country back better. If he decides to let the projects proceed, that is. Biden, himself, acknowledged last week that the positive economic impacts from his policies would occur after his term ends in January. Much of the work we ve done is already being felt by the American people, but the vast majority will not be felt, will be felt over the next 10 years, he said in remarks in the Rose Garden. It s going to take time, but it s there. The road ahead is clear. While Trump on the campaign trail railed against Biden's record, he has offered few details on what initiatives he might scrap. Trump said in September that he would rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act and said on Joe Rogan s podcast that tariffs would do more for manufacturing than the funding provided by the CHIPS and Science Act. But Biden aides privately told The Associated Press that they expect Trump to continue the planned projects and take credit for Biden's accomplishments, just like the Republicans in Congress who ve celebrated plant openings and infrastructure developments in their districts but voted against them. The administration has spent millions of dollars to put up road signs to promote Biden's role in the projects; all Trump would need to do is re-label them with his own name. Biden aides feel confident that Trump won t want to cut programs that are helping states he won in this year s election even if Republicans try for a token repeal of some provisions in order to help fund some of their own tax cut plans. When asked about this possibility, Karoline Leavitt, spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance transition, said: The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.

SKSK_Doc4_ Biden-Harris-strengthening-healthcare-cybersecurity.txt,"FACT SHEET: Biden- Harris Administration Bolsters Protections for Americans Access to Healthcare Through Strengthening Cybersecurity Recent cyberattacks targeting the nation s healthcare system have demonstrated the vulnerability of our hospitals and payment systems. Providers across the health system had to scramble for funding after one attack on a key payment system. And some hospitals had to redirect care after another. These disruptions can take too long to resolve before full access to needed health care services or payment systems is restored. Cyberattacks against the American healthcare system rose . 128% from 2022 to 2023 In February and March of 2024 alone, the United States experienced one of the most significant healthcare-related cyberattacks to date. During the attack, providers reported that one out of every three health care claims in the United States were impacted, leading to disruptions in timely payment to healthcare providers. Recognizing that effective cybersecurity is critical to Americans accessing the care they need, the Biden-Harris Administration is working relentlessly to improve the resilience of the healthcare sector to cyberattacks. Many healthcare companies are private sector owned and operated, so private sector uptake and partnership is key to meaningful improvements in the sector s ability to withstand attacks. In January of 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services launched a healthcare cybersecurity gateway website to simplify access to the Department s healthcare-specific cybersecurity information and resources and published voluntary Healthcare and Public Health Cybersecurity Performance Goals designed to help healthcare institutions plan and prioritize high-impact cybersecurity practices. 1/3 1/12/25, 9:05 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Bolsters Protections for Americans Access to Healthcare Through Strengthening C... In May of 2024, the White House convened Chief Information Security Officers and other high-level executives from across the healthcare sector spanning care delivery organizations, medical technology companies, and industry associations to advance cybersecurity solutions across the industry. Participants shared their organization s views on cybersecurity challenges and the need to work together with government to better share threat intelligence and adopt secure-by design solutions for the technologies underpinning the healthcare system. In May of 2024, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) announced the launch of the Universal Patching and Remediation for Autonomous Defense (UPGRADE) program, a cybersecurity effort that will invest more than $50 million to create tools for information technology (IT) teams to better defend the hospital environments they are tasked with securing. Healthcare-related cyber disruptions can be particularly disruptive to rural hospitals, which serve over 60 million Americans. Most rural hospitals are critical access hospitals, meaning they are located more than 35 miles from another hospital, which makes diversions of patients and staffing-intensive manual workarounds in response to attacks more difficult. Recognizing the critical role these hospitals play in the communities they serve, the White House worked with and received commitments from leading U.S. technology providers to provide free and low-cost resources for all 1,800-2,100 rural hospitals across the nation. As part of this initiative to improve security and resilience of our rural hospital system, our private sector partners have committed to the following: For independent Critical Access Hospitals and Rural Emergency Hospitals, Microsoft is extending its nonprofit program to provide grants and up to a 75% discount on security products optimized for smaller organizations. For participating larger rural hospitals already using eligible Microsoft solutions, Microsoft is providing its most advanced security suite at no additional cost for one year. Microsoft will also provide free cybersecurity assessments by qualified technology security providers and free training for frontline and IT staff at eligible rural hospitals throughout the country to deepen our resiliency to malicious cyberattacks.

GDR_Doc4_Ai_Policy_Directions.txt," Title: AI Policy Directions in the New Trump Administration Authors: John Villasenor Source/Date: Brookings Institution, November 2024 URL: Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Policy, Trump Administration, Regulation, Innovation Summary: The Trump administration s approach to artificial intelligence (AI) policy reflects a commitment to fostering innovation while addressing the regulatory and ethical challenges posed by this transformative technology. The administration s policy directions prioritize reducing regulatory barriers to accelerate AI research and development, encouraging public-private collaboration, and promoting workforce development to meet the demands of an AI-driven economy. A central focus of the administration s AI strategy is the establishment of guidelines for ethical AI use. These guidelines aim to balance the need for innovation with the imperative to prevent harm caused by biased algorithms or misuse of AI technologies. While some critics argue that the administration s approach lacks sufficient safeguards, proponents believe it provides the flexibility needed to maintain the U.S. s competitive edge. Public-private partnerships are a cornerstone of the administration s AI policy. By facilitating collaboration between federal agencies, industry leaders, and academic institutions, the administration seeks to create an ecosystem conducive to innovation. These partnerships are expected to drive advancements in areas such as healthcare, defense, and infrastructure, where AI applications can deliver substantial benefits. The administration also emphasizes the importance of workforce development to prepare Americans for the jobs of the future. Investments in STEM education and AI-specific training programs aim to equip workers with the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. These efforts include expanding access to education in underserved communities to ensure a diverse and inclusive AI workforce. On the international stage, the Trump administration advocates for collaboration with allies to set global standards for AI governance. By engaging in multilateral efforts, the U.S. seeks to promote democratic values and counter authoritarian approaches to AI development and use. This strategy underscores the administration s recognition of AI as not only a technological issue but also a geopolitical one. While the administration s AI policy has sparked debate, it underscores a forward-looking approach aimed at harnessing the transformative potential of AI.

JY_Doc3_Trump_Harris_Different_Plans.txt,"Education in the U.S. is in a state of flux. The pandemic has left students across the country with learning gaps, especially in math and science. Teacher turnover is high, with some areas hit by staffing shortages. Schools are increasingly targeted in mass shootings and effectively segregated by race. Public schools face budget cuts and declining enrollment, while states across the country are allowing taxpayer dollars to fund private education instead. The two current presidential candidates propose two sharply different paths forward for the U.S. education system. Former president Donald Trump favors what s known as school choice, or privatization, and increasing government involvement in curriculum. Vice President Kamala Harris supports programs to address inequity across early childhood, K 12 and higher education. Here s how their policy proposals measure up. Trump s most eye-catching campaign promise has been to eliminate the Department of Education. We will drain the government education swamp and stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America s youth with all sorts of things that you don t want to have our youth hearing, he said at a September rally in Wisconsin. Eliminating the agency, which provides around 11 percent of public school funding nationwide, would require an act of Congress. Even if this were to happen, the Trump campaign has not clarified what it proposes to do with the Department s two biggest programs Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which collectively provide some $34 billion in funding to educate students from low-income families and those with disabilities, respectively. But Project 2025, a recently published conservative policy agenda that has many connections to Trump but is not formally associated with his campaign, proposes sending federal funding for Title I and IDEA to states as no-strings-attached block grants meaning states could use the funds however they choose. The project also calls for phasing out federal spending on Title I funding over a 10-year period. Upending Title I funding would have a very substantial effect on districts that have higher concentrations of poverty, says Mark Weber, a public school teacher and education policy analyst at the New Jersey Policy Perspective think tank.

YCK_Doc4_Zelenskyy-Austin-use.txt,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used their final meeting Thursday to press the incoming Trump administration not to give up on Kyivs fight, with Austin warning that to cease military support now will only invite more aggression, chaos and war. Weve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions weve created, Zelenskyy said. No matter whats going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased off the map. President-elect Donald Trumps pronouncements about pushing for a quick end to the war, his kinship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and uncertainty over whether he will support further military aid to Ukraine have triggered concern among allies. The Biden administration has worked to provide Ukraine with as much military support as it can, including approving a new $500 million package of weapons and relaxing restrictions on missile strikes into Russia, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war. And while Austin acknowledged he has no idea what Trump will do, he said the international leaders gathered Thursday at Ramstein Air Base talked about the need to continue the mission. The leaders were attending a gathering of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a consortium of about 50 partner nations that Austin brought together months after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 to coordinate weapons support. Im leaving this contact group not with a farewell but with a challenge. The coalition to support Ukraine must not flinch. It must not falter. And it must not fail, Austin said during his final press conference. Ukraines survival is on the line. But so is all of our security. Some discussed what they would do if the U.S. backed away from its support for Kyiv, if the contact group would assume a new shape under one of its major European contributors, such as Germany. Germanys Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said his country and several other European nations are discussing options. Austin said the continuation of the group is essential, calling it the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy and the most consequential global coalition in more than 30 years. President Joe Biden was to have his final face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in the coming days in Rome, but he canceled the trip because of the devastating fires in California. Pistorius said he intends to travel to the U.S. shortly after Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration to meet his new counterpart to discuss the issue. Its clear a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, and it will require even more cooperation, Zelenskyy said.

DR_Doc2_Offshore_Ban_Undo.docx,"Title: Biden Issues Ban on Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling in Most Federal Waters; Trump Vows to Undo It Authors: Daly, Matthew Source/Date: Associated Press, January 6, 2025 URL: Keywords: drilling, federal, ban, offshore, Trump Total Word Count: 532 Brief Summary: The article from the Associated Press examines President Joe Biden's recent executive action to ban offshore oil and gas drilling in most federal waters and former President Donald Trump s pledge to overturn this ban should he return to office in 2025. This move by Biden aims to safeguard marine ecosystems, combat climate change, and align the U.S. with its renewable energy and carbon reduction goals. The ban, part of Biden s broader climate strategy, applies to significant portions of federal waters, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and parts of the Arctic Ocean. It also includes expanded protections for areas near the Alaskan coastline and the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental advocates have praised the decision as a major step toward reducing the United States reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating the risks posed by oil spills and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the move has sparked intense criticism from fossil fuel interests, Republican lawmakers, and some industry groups. They argue that such restrictions will hurt the U.S. economy, increase energy costs, and threaten energy security by reducing domestic oil and gas production. Critics also highlight the potential for job losses in industries reliant on offshore drilling and related activities, particularly in states like Texas, Louisiana, and Alaska, where fossil fuel production contributes significantly to the economy. The article highlights Trump s contrasting vision, which prioritizes energy independence and economic growth through the expansion of fossil fuel production. During his previous term, Trump had rolled back numerous environmental regulations and encouraged drilling in federal waters. His pledge to undo Biden s ban reflects a broader effort to return to his administration s deregulatory agenda and promote the fossil fuel industry as a cornerstone of American energy policy. The tension between these opposing approaches underscores the ongoing debate over the United States energy future. Biden s administration aims to transition to cleaner energy sources while meeting climate targets. Conversely, Trump s rhetoric resonates with those advocating for a fossil fuel-driven energy strategy, citing immediate economic benefits and reduced reliance on foreign oil. The article also touches on the broader implications of the ban for climate policy and international relations. By limiting offshore drilling, Biden signals U.S. commitment to global efforts to combat climate change, potentially strengthening alliances with nations prioritizing renewable energy and carbon neutrality. However, the potential reversal of this policy under a Trump administration could weaken global confidence in the U.S. as a stable partner in climate agreements. In summary, Biden s offshore drilling ban and Trump s vow to repeal it epitomize the ideological divide between climate action and fossil fuel promotion, with significant environmental, economic, and geopolitical ramifications. The decision highlights the stakes of the 2024 election in shaping U.S. energy policy.",Neutral,oppose,1,0,support

Minutes from the meeting, released after the typical three-week lag, also showed clear division among the Feds 19 policymakers. Some expressed support for keeping the central banks key rate unchanged, the minutes said. And a majority of the officials said the decision to cut rates was a close call. Ultimately, the Fed choose to cut its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.3%. One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged. Still, there was widespread agreement that after reducing rates for three straight meetings, it was time to undertake a more deliberate approach to their key rate. Economists said the minutes strongly suggest that Fed officials will forego a rate cut at their next meeting in January. Fewer rate cuts will likely mean that borrowing costs for consumers and businesses including for homes, cars, and credit cards will remain elevated this year. Policymakers said that the Fed was at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing, the minutes said. In projections released after the meeting,Fed officials saidthey expect just two cuts next year, down from an earlier projection of four. The minutes also showed that almost all Fed policymakers see a greater risk than before that inflation could stay higher than they expect, in part because inflation has lingered in several recent readings and because of the likely effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy. The Feds staff economists considered the economys future path particularly uncertain at the December meeting, in part because of the incoming Trump administrations potential changes to trade, immigration, fiscal, and regulatory policies, which the staff said are difficult to assess in terms of how they will impact the economy. As a result they included several different scenarios for the economys future path in their presentation to policymakers. And the staff projected that inflation this year would be about the same as in 2024 because they expected Trumps proposed tariffs would keep inflation elevated. Fed officials sent stock markets plummeting Dec. 18 after they reduced their outlook for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the meeting that the decision to reduce rates had been a close call. ",Oppose,support,0,0,support
YCK_Doc2_Blinken-Wang-discuss.txt,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated Washington's concerns over Beijing's actions toward Taiwan and its support for Russia's war in Ukraine as he met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Saturday. Blinken, who earlier called out China for escalating maritime tensions with the Philippines, talked extensively with Wang about Taiwan and Beijing's recent ""provocative"" actions toward the democratically governed island, a senior U.S. State Department official said. Those actions included a simulated blockade during the inauguration of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, the official said. Blinken and Wang agreed to keep making progress on their countries' military-to-military ties, but did not discuss nuclear arms control talks, which China has halted in protest over Washington providing arms to Taiwan, the official said. ""In every discussion, Taiwan is the issue that they care most about. They see it as ... an internal China issue,"" said the official, who briefed reporters travelling with Blinken. China's government considers Taiwan inviolable Chinese territory, which Taiwan rejects. Wang told Blinken that Taiwan was part of China and ""was not and will not be a country"", and Beijing would counter provocations by forces advocating Taiwan's independence, according to a foreign ministry statement. He said that though communication channels between China and the United States were open, Washington had intensified its efforts to contain and suppress Beijing. ""The risks facing Sino-U.S. relations are still accumulating and the challenges are rising and ties are at a critical juncture of halting their decline and achieving stability,"" Wang said. The two talked for one hour, 20 minutes on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos, in their sixth meeting since June 2023, when Blinken visited Beijing in a sign of improvement in strained relations between the world's two biggest economies. The two did not set a date for their next meeting, the official said. Blinken is touring East Asia in a bid to reassure countries close to China of U.S. commitment, despite political uncertainty at home. He travelled to Vietnam later on Saturday and was set to hold security talks alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Japan and the Philippines in the coming days. Blinken conveyed to Wang that U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, both believed in the importance of stability in the U.S.-China relationship, and that a rules-based order must be upheld, the official added. Blinken also discussed China's support for Russia's defence industrial base and warned of further U.S. actions if China does not curtail that, according to the official. Washington has levied sanctions at targets including China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of an effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine. ""There was no commitment by the Chinese to take action,"" the official said. Blinken also raised with Wang U.S. concerns over human rights in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet, and stressed the need for more progress from Beijing on counter narcotics including fentanyl precursors coming out of China.

SKSK_Doc3_ Biden-Harris-Improving-Access.txt," FACT SHEET: Biden- Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable Care Act President Biden announces nearly 24 million consumers have signed up for Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage, nearly doubling enrollment during the last 4 years President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. Since day one of their Administration, they have taken steps to ensure that every American has access to affordable, quality health care. And, as a result of these efforts, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that it has set another all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment, with nearly 24 million Americans signing up for coverage with one week left in the 2025 Open Enrollment Period. A total of 45 million Americans have coverage through the ACA either the Marketplace or Medicaid expansion and more people have health insurance today than ever in our nation s history. Statement from the President: Today, we have once again set a record when it comes to ensuring access to affordable, quality health care: nearly 24 million Americans have signed up for Affordable Care Act coverage. That means that enrollment has nearly doubled since I took office. That s no coincidence. When I took office, I made a promise to the American people that I would bring down the cost of health care and prescription drugs, make signing up for coverage easier, and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. I m proud that my Administration delivered even as Republican elected officials, who have been eager to put millions of Americans coverage at risk, stood in the way. I urge Congress to double down on the progress we have made and ensure Americans have access to quality, affordable health care by extending the ACA premium tax credit this year. Today s announcement builds upon a remarkable record of success over the last four years. More Americans have health insurance than ever before, with 1/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C... the uninsured rate at record lows. In fact, in every year of the Biden-Harris Administration, we have set a new all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment. This record-breaking enrollment is no accident, and due to this Administration s efforts to lower health care costs and make it easier to sign up for coverage. We also made health care more affordable for Americans purchasing their health insurance on the ACA Marketplace, saving consumers an average of $800 annually on their premiums. For example, this Administration made the largest ever investment in outreach and enrollment assistance, especially those in rural or underserved communities while at the same time eliminating bureaucratic red tape that makes it harder for people to enroll in coverage. But all of these efforts to lower health care costs and expand coverage are now in danger. If Republicans in Congress take away the enhanced premium tax credits that make ACA coverage more affordable, premiums will skyrocket and people will lose coverage. For many families the results will be catastrophic: A single parent earing $50,00 per year could see their premiums increase by $1600 per year. 2/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C... A retired couple earning $85,000 per year could see their premiums increase by $18,000 per year. Experts estimate that 3 to 5 million people would become uninsured. The Affordable Care Act Marketplaces are just one part of this Administration s commitment to health care coverage. Today, Medicaid covers about 80 million people. Thanks to the President s leadership, over one million Americans in four states now have Medicaid expansion coverage, driving total ACA-related enrollment to over 45 million. This Administration has also cut red tape to make applying for and renewing Medicaid coverage easier, and established new standards to ensure people have access to the care they need when they need it. In addition to today s record-breaking enrollment numbers, we are also releasing a report and a data chart pack detailing the Biden-Harris Administration s historic progress to improve the health of millions of Americans from making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, to tackling crises in mental health, maternal health, and more, and investing in public health infrastructure. Some highlights include: In its first year alone, President Biden s Medicare Drug Price Negotiation program outperformed expectations, achieving negotiated prices that are 38 to 79 percent lower than U.S. list prices for the ten first round negotiated drugs. These prices are $6 billion per year lower than what Medicare pays today and, once in effect, will put $1.5 billion dollars back into the pockets of Medicare beneficiaries. Seniors with Medicare are protected by the new $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs, and insulin is capped at just $35 per month. The Administration ended the family glitch, making millions of family members finally eligible for affordable ACA Marketplace coverage with about one million people projected to either gain coverage or have lower premiums. The 988 lifeline, created under this Administration, has answered more than 11 million calls, chats, and texts and made it easier for individuals experiencing distress to access immediate care.

NC_Doc1.docx,"Trump will not rule out force to take Panama Canal, Greenland By Steve Holland and Joseph Ax January 8, 202510:24 AM CST PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump refused on Tuesday to rule out using military or economic action to pursue acquisition of the Panama Canal and Greenland, part of a broader expansionist agenda he has promoted since winning the Nov. 5 election. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, also floated the idea of turning Canada into a U.S. state, said he would demand far higher defense spending from NATO allies and promised to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Still two weeks away from taking office, Trump has begun outlining an aggressive foreign policy with little regard to diplomatic considerations or the concerns of U.S. allies. Asked at a press conference at his Florida resort whether he could assure the world he would not use military or economic coercion as he tries to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, Trump said, ""No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security."" Trump criticized American spending on Canadian goods and military support for Canada, saying the U.S. derives no benefits from doing so, and called the border between the two countries an ""artificially drawn line."" He suggested he would impose tariffs on Denmark if it resists his offer to purchase Greenland, which he said is vital to U.S. national security. Shortly before Trump's comments, his son Don Jr. arrived in Greenland for a private visit. Denmark has said Greenland, a self-governing part of its kingdom, is not for sale. ""I don't think it's a good way forward to fight each other with financial means when we are close allies and partners,"" Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late on Tuesday in response to Trump's comments. CANADA SAYS: 'WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN' Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Melanie Joly, said on X, ""President-elect Trump's comments show a complete lack of understanding of what makes Canada a strong country. Our economy is strong. Our people are strong. We will never back down in the face of threats."" Panama's top diplomat also pushed back on the incoming U.S. leader's threat to retake the key global waterway, which the U.S. had built and owned before handing over control to the Central American nation in 1999. ""The only hands that control the canal are Panamanian and that's how it will continue to be,"" Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters on Tuesday. Ambassador Daniel Fried, a retired U.S. diplomat now with the Atlantic Council think tank, said Trump's comments painted a picture of national power as territorial expansion and compared him to a ""19th century imperialist."" Seizing Greenland, Fried said, ""would destroy NATO, because it would make us no different than Vladimir Putin,"" Russia's president. Trump's promise to rename the Gulf of Mexico echoed his previous vow to revert the name of Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. Former President Barack Obama changed the name of the Alaskan mountain in deference to Native Americans. Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who is expected to play a key role in looming U.S.-Mexico trade issues, appeared to dismiss Trump's call to rename the shared body of water later on Tuesday. ""Today I'd tell you if we saw each other in 30 years, the Gulf of Mexico will still be called the Gulf of Mexico,"" he said, adding that the Mexican government would not get drawn into the debate. Typically, the U.S. Board of Geographic Names sets geographic names, though presidents have also renamed geographic features via executive action. Trump said NATO members should spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense, a significant increase from the current 2% target. ""I think NATO should have 5%,"" he said. ""They can all afford it, but they should be at 5%, not 2%."" Trump has frequently complained that most NATO members are not paying their fair share, and he floated demanding an increase in NATO defense contributions during the campaign. NATO estimated that 23 of its 32 members would meet its goal of spending 2% of GDP in 2024. None of the alliance members, including the U.S., currently spends 5% of GDP on defense, according to NATO figures. Poland is the highest spender in GDP terms at 4.12%, followed by Estonia at 3.43% and the United States at 3.38%. Trump also repeated his threat that ""all hell will break out in the Middle East"" if Palestinian Hamas militants do not release by the time he takes office hostages it abducted from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and still hold in the Gaza Strip. ""It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,"" he said. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, told reporters he hopes to have good things to report on negotiations between Israel and Hamas by the time Trump is sworn into office. FAMILIAR GRIEVANCES The free-wheeling, hour-long press conference, Trump's second since his victory, echoed similar events during his presidential campaign. He aired a series of familiar grievances about his criminal indictments, including attacking Justice Juan Merchan, the New York judge who is scheduled to sentence Trump on Friday for falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn star. A New York appeals court denied his latest bid to halt the sentencing shortly after his press conference ended. Separately, as Trump was speaking, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigations into Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The judge, Aileen Cannon, had previously dismissed the case charging Trump with illegally retaining classified materials after leaving office. Tuesday's event took place in the ornate living room at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach resort. Several of Trump's senior advisers watched the proceedings, while club guests could be seen outside dining on the terrace. Trump was also asked whether it was appropriate for Elon Musk to publicly weigh in on foreign affairs.
