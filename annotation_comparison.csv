By Mack enzie T atananni Follow Updat ed Dec 30, 2024, 4:30 pm EST / Original Dec 30, 2024, 11:45 am EST Donald Trump s outspoken support of the H-1B visa program bodes well for companies like Amazon.com and Alphabet s Google, who are among the top employers of foreign workers. Trump s remarks have ignited a political firestorm on social media, with the president-elect seeming to embrace the program despite initially arguing that it would cost domestic workers jobs. In an interview with the New York Post on Saturday, Trump praised the great program, describing himself as a believer in H-1B . His enthusiasm points to a positive outcome for Amazon and Google, two of the companies to get the most Labor Condition Applications approved in fiscal 2024. These documents, known as LCAs, must be filed with the Department of Labor to employ nonimmigrant workers on several types of visas, including H-1Bs. Donald Trump s support of the H-1B visa program was a good sign for Amazon and Google, two top employers of H-1B visa holders. (AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES)1/11/25, 1:26 PM Is the Party Over? Alcohol Stocks Are Having a Terrible Start to 2025. - Barron's 1/5Data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows that Amazon remained a top sponsor for foreign workers in fiscal 2024. The online retailer had the most H-1B petitions approved for initial employment, at 3,871. Google came in eighth, with 1,058 applications approved, right below Microsoft 1,264 petitions. Many of the top sponsors are large-cap technology companies, such as Infosys , Apple , and Meta Platforms . Cognizant Technology Solutions , a New Jersey-based IT and consulting company, had the second-most LCAs approved for initial employment, at 2,837. Trump s shifting stance on the H-1B program aligns him with billionaire capitalists like Elon Musk, whose own company, Tesla , is among the top employers of H-1B visa holders. In fiscal 2024 alone, the auto maker had 742 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment more than double the 328 approved in 2023 and the 337 approved in 2022. The National Foundation for American Policy noted that Tesla showed a significant increase in H-1B approved petitions, propelling it into the top 25 employers after failing to make the ranking in prior years. While this is a fraction of Amazon s approvals , Musk has remained among the most outspoken supporters of the skilled-worker visa program. Musk has vowed to go to war to defend the program. The debate kicked off with Trump s selection of Sriram Krishnan as a senior advisor on artificial-intelligence policy.1/11/25, 1:26 PM Is the Party Over? Alcohol Stocks Are Having a Terrible Start to 2025. - Barron's 2/5Krishnan came to the U.S. on an L-1 Visa in 2007 and has since advocated for the removal of caps on green cards to unlock skilled immigration. While Trump claimed he has always been in favor of the visas himself, his policy record says otherwise. In June 2020, Trump signed an executive order barring foreign nationals from using certain temporary employment-based visas through the end of the year. The order also extended a green card ban enacted in April. That October, a new Department of Labor rule required employers to pay H-1B holders higher wages, with Trump administration officials asserting that it would dissuade American companies from embracing foreign labor. Courts later determined that the administration s actions were unlawful, forcing a settlement. In subsequent years, employers have experienced low denial rates for H-1B petitions. Denial rates declined nationally from 21% in 2019 to 4% in 2021, only to shrink further to 2.2% in 2022. In fiscal 2024, the number was 2.5%. Amazon and Google were among the companies with a 1% denial rate. The tech giants have a longstanding relationship with the visa program. In 2008, Laszlo Bock, then-Google s vice president for people operations, testified that around 8% of the company s U.S.- based employees were working on H-1B visas. If U.S. employers are unable to hire those who are graduating from our universities, foreign competitors will, Bock said during an1/11/25, 1:26 PM Is the Party Over?

The U.S. scientific, engineering, and tech communities cannot hope to maintain their present position of international leadership if they are unable to hire and retain highly educated foreign talent. The U.S. caps the number of H-1B visas at 65,000 new visas each year. However, an additional 20,000 can be granted to those with a master s degree or higher. The visa lasts three years but can be granted an extension for an additional three years beyond the expiration date. USCIS data show the vast majority of H-1B visa holders hail from India, at over 70%. If Trump s enthusiasm for the program holds, the top sponsors could have an even easier time recruiting foreign labor during his second administration. Alphabet, Google s parent company, noted in a Form 10-K that restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes could impact its ability to hire or retain its global talent.

AJJ_Doc2_DACA-Health-Birthright.txt,"Expected Immigration Policies Under a Second Trump Administration and Their Health and Economic Implications Drishti Pillai and Samantha Artiga Published: Nov 21, 2024 Note: This content was updated on January 6, 2025, to reflect recent court decisions regarding the ACA coverage expansion to DACA recipients. Introduction Immigration was a central campaign issue during the 2024 Presidential election with President-elect Trump vowing to take strict action to restrict both lawful and unlawful immigration into the U.S. Such actions would have stark impacts on the health and well- being of immigrant families as well as major economic consequences for the nation. As of 2023, there were 47.1 million immigrants residing in the U.S., and one in four children had an immigrant parent. Increased immigration boosts federal revenues and lowers the national deficit through immigrants participation in the country s economy, workforce, and through billions of dollars in tax contributions .1 The independent source for health policy research, polling, and news. Email*Sign up for the latest on health policy research, polling, and news every week. Subscribe1/11/25, 5:30 PM Expected Immigration Policies Under a Second Trump Administration and Their Health and Economic Implications | KFF 1/10This issue brief discusses key changes to immigration policies that may take place under the second Trump administration based on his previous record and campaign statements, and their implications. President-elect Trump has indicated plans to restrict and eliminate legal immigration pathways, including humanitarian protections, and deport millions of immigrants, which would likely lead to separation of families, negative mental and physical impacts for immigrant families, and negative consequences on the nation s workforce and economy. Expected Policy Changes Elimination of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program The future of the DACA program remains uncertain due to pending litigation, and President-elect Trump tried to eliminate DACA during his first term; over half a million DACA recipients would lose protected status if it is eliminated. DACA was originally established via executive action in June 2012 to protect certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children from removal proceedings and receive authorization to work for renewable two-year periods. During his prior term, President-elect Trump sought to end DACA but was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2020. The Biden administration issued regulations in 2022 to preserve DACA protections. In September 2023 , a district court in Texas ruled the DACA program unlawful, preventing the Biden administration from implementing the new regulations while the case awaits a decision in the Fih Circuit Court of Appeals. Under pending court rulings , while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is accepting first-time DACA requests, it is unable to process them. DHS is continuing to process DACA renewal requests and related requests for employment authorization. Aer the attempt to end DACA failed in 2020, the Trump administration said that it would try again to eliminate DACA protections, and, if the pending court ruling finds the program unlawful, the administration is unlikely to appeal the decision. However, in a recent interview , President-elect Trump indicated that he would work on addressing the status of Dreamers and indicated a willingness to work with Democrats on the issue, although the details of this proposed plan remain unclear. There are over half a million active DACA recipients, a majority of whom are working and many of whom have U.S.-born children, who could be at risk of deportation if the program is eliminated. A recent health coverage expansion to DACA recipients also is subject to pending litigation , with DACA recipients in 19 states being ineligible to enroll in ACA Marketplace coverage as of December 23, 2024. In May 2024, the Biden administration published regulations to extend eligibility for Aordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace coverage with premium and cost-sharing subsidies to DACA recipients, who were previously ineligible for federally funded health coverage options. The regulation became eective November 1, 2024, allowing for enrollment during the 2025 Open Enrollment Period. In August 2024, a group of 19 states filed a lawsuit against the federal government alleging that the ACA Marketplace coverage expansion to DACA recipients violates the Administrative Procedure Act. On December 9, 2024, a federal court in North Dakota granted the plaintis motion by blocking the ACA coverage expansion from being implemented in the 19 states that filed the lawsuit (AL, AR, FL, IA, ID, IN, KS, KY, MS, MT, ND, NE, NH, OH, SC, SD, TN, TX, VA). On December 16, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a temporary stay of the federal court s injunction, temporarily allowing DACA recipients in all states to sign up for ACA Marketplace coverage. However, on December 23, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the administrative stay, thereby making DACA recipients in the aforementioned 19 states ineligible for ACA Marketplace coverage again. Elimination of the coverage expansion in some states could leave thousands of uninsured DACA recipients in those states without an aordable coverage option. Changes to Public Charge Policy President-elect Trump could reinstate changes to public charge policy that he made during his first term, which led to increased fears and misinformation among immigrant families about accessing programs and services, including health coverage. Under longstanding immigration policy, federal oicials can deny entry to the U.S. or adjustment to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status (i.e., a green card ) to someone they determine to be a public charge . During his prior term, President-elect Trump issued regulations in 2019 that broadened the scope of programs that the federal government would consider in public charge determinations to newly include the use of non-cash assistance programs like Medicaid and the Children s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Research suggests that these changes increased fears among immigrant families about participating in programs and seeking services, including health coverage and care. Prior KFF analysis estimated that the 2019 changes to public charge policy could have led to decreased coverage for between 2 to 4.7 million Medicaid or CHIP enrollees who were noncitizens or citizens living in a mixed immigration status family. The Biden administration rescinded these changes. However, as of 2023, a majority of immigrant adults said in a KFF survey that they were not sure about public charge rules, and roughly one in ten (8%), rising to about one in four (27%) of likely undocumented immigrant adults, said they have avoided applying for assistance with food, housing, or health care in the past year due to immigration-related fears (Figure 1). As of November 2024, President-elect Trump has not indicated whether his administration plans to reinstate his first term changes to public charge policy. Figure 1 About One in Four Undocumented Immigrant Adults Says They Have Avoided Applying for Assistance with Food, Housing, or Health Care Due to Immigration-Related Fears Percent of immigrant adults who say they avoided applying for a government program that helps pay for food, housing, or health care in the past year because they didn't want to draw attention to their or a family member's immigration status: Total immigrant adults Im m igration Status Naturalized citizen Lawfully present immigrant Likely undocumented 8% 4% 8% 27%1/11/25, 5:30 PM Expected Immigration Policies Under a Second Trump Administration and Their Health and Economic Implications | KFF 4/10Expanded Interior Enforcement Actions President-elect Trump has indicated that his administration plans to carry out mass detentions and deportations of millions of immigrants, including long-term residents, which could lead to family separations and negative mental and physical health consequences. President-elect Trump has stated that he will declare a national emergency and use the U.S. military to carry out mass deportations of tens of millions of undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S., many of whom have been living and working in the country for decades. Such a policy could lead to family separations as well as mass detentions , which can have negative implications for the mental health and well-being of immigrant families and also put their physical health at risk. Tom Homan, who was the director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the first Trump administration and has been selected as the incoming administration s border czar , has said that it is possible to carry out mass deportations without separating families by deporting an entire family unit together, even if the child may be a U.S. citizen. As was the case during his first term, he may also carry out workplace raids as part of mass deportation eorts. Research shows that such raids can lead to family separations, poor physical and mental health outcomes for immigrant families, negative birth and educational outcomes for the children of immigrants, and financial hardship due to employment losses. Prior KFF research shows that restrictive immigration policies implemented during the first Trump administration, including detention and deportation led to increased fears and stress among immigrant families and negatively impacted the health and well-being of children of immigrants, most of whom are U.S. citizens .1/11/25, 5:30 PM Expected Immigration Policies Under a Second Trump Administration and Their Health and Economic Implications | KFF 5/10Mass deportations could also negatively impact the U.S. workforce and economy, where immigrants make significant contributions. Immigrants have similar rates of employment as their U.S.-born counterparts and play outsized roles in certain occupations such as agriculture , construction, and health care . Research has found that immigrants do not displace U.S.-born workers and help foster job growth through entrepreneurship and the consumption of goods and services. Further, federal data show that unemployment rates for U.S.-born workers have not decreased between 2022 and 2023 and have remained similar to those for immigrant workers. In addition, immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, pay billions of dollars in federal, state, and local taxes each year. Mass deportation of immigrants could lead to workforce shortages in key sectors which could have negative economic consequences including an increase in the cost of essential goods such as groceries . Vice President-elect Vance has stated that immigrants are responsible for the U.S. housing crisis. While some studies show a link between immigration and rising housing costs, in general, economists are skeptical of immigration being a primary driver. Mass deportation of immigrants could also worsen housing shortages since immigrants make up a significant share of construction workers. Workplace raids can exacerbate existing labor shortages and have a negative impact on the local economies of the communities where they take place. Further, research shows that without the contributions undocumented immigrants make to the Medicare Trust Fund , it would reach insolvency earlier, and that undocumented immigrants result in a net positive eect on the financial status of Social Security . There also is likely to be a significant cost to taxpayers for the government to carry out large-scale detention and deportations. Ending Birthright Citizenship President-elect Trump has stated that he will sign an executive order to end birthright citizenship for the children of some immigrants despite it being a guaranteed right under the U.S. Constitution, which would negatively impact the health care workforce and economy. This proposed action would limit access to health coverage and care for the children of immigrants since they may not have lawful status. It could also have broader ramifications for the nation s workforce and economy, potentially exacerbating existing worker shortages , including in health care. KFF analysis of federal data shows that adult children of immigrants have slightly better educational and economic outcomes than adult children of U.S.-born parents and make up twice the share of physicians, surgeons, and other health care practitioners as compared to their share of the population (13% vs. 6%) (Figure 2). Other research also has found that children of immigrants contribute more in taxes on average than their parents or the rest of the U.S.-born population, and that their fiscal contributions exceed their costs associated with health care, education, and other social services.

The first Trump administration implemented Migrant Protection Protocols1/11/25, 5:30 PM Expected Immigration Policies Under a Second Trump Administration and Their Health and Economic Implications | KFF 7/10, oen referred to as the Remain in Mexico policy, in 2019. Under this policy, asylum seekers were required to remain in Mexico, oen in unsafe conditions , while they awaited their immigration court hearings. The Biden administration ended this policy in 2022, following some legal challenges, although it implemented a series of increasingly restrictive limits on asylum eligibility in 2023 and 2024 in response to a high number of border encounters. President-elect Trump said he plans to reinstate the Migrant Protection Protocols. He also has indicated that he will deploy the National Guard , as well as active duty military personnel , if needed, to the U.S.-Mexico border, although details of the plan remain unclear . Heightened military presence at the border can lead to increased fears among immigrant families living in border areas and using part of the military budget for border security could face legal challenges . Restrictions on Humanitarian Protections President-elect Trump said he plans to significantly limit the entry of humanitarian migrants into the U.S. during his second term by restricting refugee limits , shutting down the CBP One application for asylum seekers, and eliminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS ) designations for immigrants from some countries. During his first term, President Trump set the annual refugee admissions ceiling at its lowest levels, ranging from 50,000 in 2017 to a historic low of 18,000 in 2020. The Biden administration increased the limit to 65,000 in 2021, a level close to the annual ceilings prior to the first Trump term, and further increased the limits in 2022 and 2024 in response to humanitarian concerns . It is likely that President-elect Trump will reduce the admissions ceiling for refugees in his second term. The President-elect has also said that he will close the CBP One application created by the Biden administration which allows1/11/25, 5:30 PM Expected Immigration Policies Under a Second Trump Administration and Their Health and Economic Implications | KFF 8/10GET THE LATEST ON HEALTH POLICY Sign Up For Email Alertsasylum seekers to seek lawful entry to the U.S. by making an interview appointment with the DHS. While there have been implementation challenges with the CBP One application, shutting down the application could lead to mass cancellation of appointments and possibly an increase in attempts to cross the border outside of ports of entry. President-elect Trump also has indicated that he will roll back TPS designations for some immigrants, including those from Haiti. TPS designations protect immigrants from countries deemed unsafe by the DHS from deportation and provide them with employment authorization but do not provide a pathway to long-term residency or citizenship. As of March 2024, over 860,000 immigrants from 16 countries were protected by TPS. Loss of TPS would put people at risk for deportation, which could contribute to family separation which in turn can have negative impacts on the mental and physical health of immigrant families, and broader negative consequences for the workforce and economy.

Dominic Basulto, The Motley Fool November 26, 2024 5 min read Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is no longer a sleeping dog. The world's most popular meme coin is now up 188% over the past 30 days, and a staering 340% year to date. In the aftermath of Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidency, Dogecoin has been one of the hottest performers in the crypto market. What's going on here? Is this yet another example of a meme coin exploding in value due to hype and buzz, or is there something really behind Dogecoin's recent resurgence? Let's take a closer look. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter. Sign Up For Free The Elon Musk narrative Dogecoin's return to prominence has been fueled by the pro-crypto optimism surrounding the Trump administration. On the campaign trail, Trump made several pro-crypto promises. While none of them pertain specifically to Dogecoin, they do point to a new pro-business regulatory regime for crypto, as well as the growing mainstream acceptance of crypto within the investment world. All of that, of course, would be positive for Dogecoin. StartEngineSee How StartEngine Doubled Revenue YoY for First Half of 2024. View T erms. $800 million + raised. Learn Mo But what really seems to be behind Dogecoin's breakout is the unofficial support of billionaire Elon Musk, who has been tasked by Trump with creating a new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE for short. As a result, ""DOGE"" has been making headlines in the traditional financial media and on social media. Since DOGE is the ticker symbol for Dogecoin, it's easy to see why crypto traders have been rushing to buy this meme coin.While Musk has never officially said that Dogecoin would become a part of the future of DOGE, the anticipation is that somehow the tech billionaire will find a way to integrate crypto into its strategy. Maybe Musk will help make it possible to pay your taxes in Dogecoin instead of dollars one day? It's the same kind of anticipation that stoked a mini-rally in Dogecoin when Musk acquired Twitter (now known as X) in April 2022. Crypto bulls thought Dogecoin integration for Twitter would be coming soon, given Musk's prior support for Dogecoin. More than two years later, it has thus far not materialized. Coinbase joins the DOGE debate If it were just Musk banging the drum for DOGE, it might be easy to ignore the latest Dogecoin hype. After all, we've seen this same story before with Twitter. But now a number of high-profile business leaders are starting to talk up DOGE. One of those is Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase Global. According to Armstrong, DOGE -- the government entity, not the coin -- is all about economic freedom, reducing the size of government, and eradicating government waste. He has even suested that DOGE might lead to the abolishment of the individual income tax or a new constitutional amendment to limit government spending. So we're not just talking about a few nips and tucks to save the government some money, we're talking about huge, fundamental ideas that could influence the future of America. Why do people invest in meme coins? That's why I think Dogecoin's recent rally is more than just a fad -- it points to something significant happening within American society.

Trump was roundly mocked for his latest trolling of Canada, but his apparent fixation is dangerous at a time when the country s Liberal government, long weakened, is in disarray following the shock resignation of Chrystia Freeland as finance minister and deputy prime minister. In fact, in her December resignation letter, Freeland placed the country s response to Trump at the heart of her critique of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada s wannabe leader and his wife?

He s openly challenging the very idea of Canadian sovereignty. Canada must respond accordingly. It can be hard to fully understand the nature and the extent of threats posed by someone so willing to flout respected political and diplomatic conventions. His annexation threats create a constant set of multifaceted challenges to Canada s economic prosperity, democratic norms and sovereignty. The economic dimension of his threat to Canada is now well-known. Trump s proposed 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian exports to the U.S. are going to be incredibly costly to both countries, given the integration of their economies. But given the size disparity between the two countries, the impact will be bigger in Canada. The democratic threat is also clear. Trump has shown he regards democracy not as a crucial set of rules and norms, but as a set of obstacles to overcome. He s unable to admit defeat or even graciously accept victory. His revenge tour has begun, with lawsuits against media outlets and even against a pollster whose data suggested Democrat Kamala Harris was pulling ahead during the late days of the U.S. election campaign. Once back in the White House, Trump has promised to use public institutions to punish opponents. A partisan U.S. Supreme Court decision last year ensures that even if his own actions are criminal, he will remain immune from prosecution. Trump s disrespect of democratic institutions is corrosive and contagious. During his first term, experts sounded alarm bells about how he was linked to democratic decline around the world. If the U.S. president can openly challenge democratic norms, after all, what s to stop other would-be demagogues from doing the same? A second Trump administration is likely to continue such trends, and his willingness to intervene in Canadian politics is already causing shock waves north of the border. Violent protesters loyal to Trump storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)1/11/25, 5:43 PM Canada s fight with Trump isn t just economic, it s existential 4/7A threat to Canadian sovereignty Trump s actions have repeatedly suggested he has no respect for those he views as powerless and right now Canada fits the bill. He s made it a running joke that Canada is not a real country, but just another American state. Nervously laughing off this threat doesn t cut it as a response. Canada has so far acted in a manner that makes it seem as though Trump has a point. Rather than pushing back by defending Canada s strong record in managing its part of the border relationship, the government immediately promised more than $1 billion in new border spending. Canada s leaders have failed to call out Trump s threats as the bluster of a bully. In the face of Trump s tariff threats, Trudeau made a surprise trip to Florida to pay his respects to the president-elect and plead Canada s case, rather than observing the normal protocol and waiting for a formal post-inauguration state visit. This made Trudeau appear more like a supplicant than a visiting head of government. It s helpful in this situation to think of Trump as a schoolyard bully demanding someone else do his homework in this case, defend America s borders. Such bullying doesn t end when you give in to the bully, but only when it becomes clear you won t. Border protection is a core function of any state, and a responsibility of any American president. Trump s demand that others do it for him is both a sign of weakness and an attempt to create a scapegoat should his efforts fail. As with any bully, if you promise to do the work for him, you ll just encourage additional torment. So when Trudeau promised to do more in exchange for an end to the bullying, he got a kick in the pants for his efforts as Trump began to taunt him about being the governor of the 51st American state.

If Canada hopes to enjoy the respect of its peers, it must show a willingness to fight for itself, its prosperity and its values. It must defend its sovereignty from those who refuse to respect it, and act assertively to maintain Canadian prosperity. That could mean a trade war. Power imbalance For more than a century, Canada and the U.S. have found ways to co-operate and prosper side by side despite the fact that the U.S. is a much more powerful nation. They ve built alliances and agreements founded on shared norms, values and customs as part of a deep and multifaceted relationship. Read more: Biden-Trudeau meeting caps two and a half centuries of Canada-U.S. relations None of that history seems to matter to Trump, and now American power seemingly matters more than Canadian sovereignty. This power imbalance is all the more acute given Canada s dependence on the American economy and American military might. But Canada is not powerless. Dependency works both ways, and the deep integration of the two countries economies makes the U.S. vulnerable as well. Shutting off power exports, as Ontario Premier Doug Ford suggests, is one course of action that would have an immediate and significant detrimental effect on the American economy. Ditto for petroleum. Energy is power in more ways than one.

Panama and Denmark can already attest to that. Finding ways to creatively push back against such demands should be an imperative for any country that values its independence, and Canada needs to work with such allies. Trump will soon be U.S. president again. But he is not and should not be treated as the president of Canada.

These changes reflect a departure from the prior administration's more cautious approach, which emphasized oversight and regulation to ensure ethical use and mitigate potential risks. Instead, the Trump administration's strategy centers on creating an environment conducive to technological advancement by minimizing barriers for companies and researchers working in AI.

HKK_Doc1_Biden-Administration-Releases.txt,"Biden administration releases long-awaited hydrogen tax rules The Treasury Department finalized long-awaited tax guidance Friday for the production of clean hydrogen, a low-emissions energy source that could see federal support wane under President-elect Donald Trump. The rules outline how companies can obtain tax credits for hydrogen under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. For some of the biggest perks, the rules target hydrogen produced with renewable energy and electrolysis, which is referred to as green hydrogen. The final guidance changes several provisions from a proposal issued last year, including allowing hydrogen made from some nuclear plants that avoid retirement to obtain credits. The rule supports use of carbon capture and renewable natural gas, but also largely keeps in tact three pillars backed by environmentalists that require developers to use new clean energy added to the grid to produce hydrogen. These rules incorporate helpful feedback from companies planning investments which will drive significant deployment of clean hydrogen to power heavy industry and help create goodpaying jobs, said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo in a statement. Proposed guidance released a year ago sparked an outcry from many U.S. companies and some lawmakers who want to produce hydrogen energy with fossil fuels. Treasury officials said they reviewed roughly 30,000 comments before making changes to the rule. Trump was critical of hydrogen on the campaign trail, and congressional Republicans could scale back federal funding for the fuel or reverse the tax credit as part of a reconciliation bill in early 2025. The Biden administration has promoted the role hydrogen could play in curbing emissions from sectors such as steel, chemicals and heavy-duty transportation. Last year, the administration selected seven hydrogen hubs to receive up to $7 billion from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. In mid-December, the Department of Energy launched environmental reviews for three of the hubs. Environmental groups have voiced concerns about clean hydrogen, arguing rules governing its production should be strict to ensure the fuel cuts emissions and does not harm water resources.",Support,support
HKK_Doc2_Biden-Signs-Social.txt,"Biden signs Social Security bill, says American retirees deserve economic security and dignity President Biden on Sunday signed a Social Security bill repealing two statutes that have diminished payouts to public sector workers including firefighters and teachers for years. The bill I m signing today is about a simple proposition, Biden said before signing the Social Security Fairness Act. Americans who have worked hard all their lives to earn an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity. That s the entire purpose of the Social Security system crafted by [former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] nearly 90 years ago, the president added. Late last month, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Social Security Fairness Act by a 76-20 margin. The month before, the bill passed the House via a 327-75 vote. One of the statutes the Social Security Fairness Act repeals, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), was enacted in 1983 and reduced Social Security benefits for workers receiving government pensions not covered by Social Security. The Social Security Fairness Act also repeals the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which was enacted in 1977 and shrunk benefits for spouses, widows and widowers with spouses receiving public sector pensions. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), the sponsor of the Social Security Fairness Act, said Sunday in a thread on the social platform X that she was honored to be in attendance for the signing of the Social Security Fairness Act into law. I have fought for this change since 2003, when I held the first-ever Senate hearing on repealing the WEP and GPO, and I am proud that this law will ensure public service no longer comes at the expense of the retirement benefits earned by an individual or their spouse, Collins added later in her thread. Biden said Sunday before signing the bill that previous law that existed denied millions of Americans access to the full Social Security benefits they earned, by thousands of dollars a year.

HKK_Doc3_Biden-Funded-New.txt,"Biden funded new factories and infrastructure projects, but Trump might get to cut the ribbons All that's left is for President-elect Donald Trump to put his name on it if he wants. Trump won the White House in large part because of voters' frustration with high prices and a sense that the United States needs major changes. But when he enters office in January, Trump will inherit an economy primed for growth. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is easing and President Joe Biden's administration has teed-up a ready-made list of infrastructure projects that could go from theoretical to reality over the next several years. There s the TSMC computer chip plant in Arizona, the new Hyundai electric vehicle factory in Georgia and a modernized I-375 in Michigan, among thousands of projects under way that will take years to complete. All of that means it could be Trump, rather than Biden, who gets to tell Americans that he built the country back better. If he decides to let the projects proceed, that is. Biden, himself, acknowledged last week that the positive economic impacts from his policies would occur after his term ends in January. Much of the work we ve done is already being felt by the American people, but the vast majority will not be felt, will be felt over the next 10 years, he said in remarks in the Rose Garden. It s going to take time, but it s there. The road ahead is clear. While Trump on the campaign trail railed against Biden's record, he has offered few details on what initiatives he might scrap. Trump said in September that he would rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act and said on Joe Rogan s podcast that tariffs would do more for manufacturing than the funding provided by the CHIPS and Science Act. But Biden aides privately told The Associated Press that they expect Trump to continue the planned projects and take credit for Biden's accomplishments, just like the Republicans in Congress who ve celebrated plant openings and infrastructure developments in their districts but voted against them. The administration has spent millions of dollars to put up road signs to promote Biden's role in the projects; all Trump would need to do is re-label them with his own name. Biden aides feel confident that Trump won t want to cut programs that are helping states he won in this year s election even if Republicans try for a token repeal of some provisions in order to help fund some of their own tax cut plans. When asked about this possibility, Karoline Leavitt, spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance transition, said: The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.

HKK_Doc4_Republicans-RNC-Blame.txt,"Republicans at RNC blame Biden for inflation. Economists say it's misleading Speakers at the Republican National Convention this week have faulted the Biden administration for putting the nation at risk from threats that include criminals, illicit drugs -- and high prices. ""American families have been crushed by inflation,"" Michigan Senate candidate Mike Rogers told the audience in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, described the ""silent creep of inflation unleashed by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris."" Some economists who spoke to ABC News took issue with the blame placed on President Joe Biden as an overstatement of his role in the price spike. Instead, they said, the bout of rapidly rising prices emerged from a supply shortage imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. Pandemic-era spending measures enacted by former President Donald Trump and Biden also contributed to the price spike, the economists added, but they differed on the share of responsibility that should be apportioned to each of the major party candidates. ""There's a long list of reasons for the high inflation. At the top of the list is the pandemic and the Russian war,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News. Some of the inflation owes to the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan signed by Biden in 2021, Zandi said. But, he added, ""It's at the bottom of the list."" The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Price increases have slowed significantly from a peak of more than 9% in June 2022, though inflation remains a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%. Even after that progress made in the inflation fight, cumulative price increases during the Biden administration continue to take a toll on consumers, especially the rise in costs for essential goods like food and gas. Like so many economic problems, inflation emerged due to an imbalance between supply and demand. Hundreds of millions across the globe facing lockdowns replaced restaurant expenditures with online orders of couches and exercise bikes. But the demand for goods and labor far outpaced supply, as COVID-related bottlenecks slowed delivery times and infection fears kept workers on the sidelines. ""The most important factor for inflation is the recovery from the pandemic,"" Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, told ABC News. ""The process of coming back took longer than expected, in particular the supply constraints."" To supercharge the recovery, Trump and Biden enacted economic stimulus meant to support people who'd lost their jobs or faced other financial hardship. That stimulus helped bring about a speedy economic recovery from the March 2020 downturn, triggering a surge in demand and a blitz of hiring. ",Neutral,oppose

With the inflation rate easing and the economy holding in, policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to keep the benchmark overnight borrowing rate in a targeted range between 5.25%-5.5%. Along with the decision to stay on hold, committee members penciled in at least three rate cuts in 2024, assuming quarter percentage point increments. Thats less than what the market had been pricing, but more aggressive than what officials had previously indicated. Markets had widely anticipated the decision to stay put, which could end a cycle that has seen 11 hikes, pushing the fed funds rate to its highest level in more than 22 years. There was uncertainty, though, about how ambitious the FOMC might be regarding policy easing. Following the release of the decision, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 400 points, surpassing 37,000 for the first time. Inflation has eased from its highs, and this has come without a significant increase in unemployment. Thats very good news,Chair Jerome Powellsaid duringa news conference. That echoed new language in the post-meeting statement. The committee added the qualifier that inflation has eased over the past year while maintaining its description of prices as elevated.Fed officials see core inflation falling to 3.2% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024, then to 2.2% in 2025. Finally, it gets back to the 2% target in 2026. Economic data released this week showed both consumer and wholesale prices were little changed in November. By some measures, though, the Fed is nearing its 2% inflation target. Bank of Americas calculations indicate that the Feds preferred inflation gauge will be around 3.1% year over year in November, and could hit a 2% six-month annualized rate, meeting the central banks goal. Committee members upgraded gross domestic product to grow at a 2.6% annualized pace in 2023, a half percentage point increase from the last update in September. Officials see GDP at 1.4% in 2024, roughly unchanged from the previous outlook. Projections for the unemployment rate were largely unchanged, at 3.8% in 2023 and rising to 4.1% in subsequent years. Officials have stressed their willingness to hike rates again if inflation flares up. However, most have said they can be patient now as they watch the impact the previous policy tightening moves are having on the U.S. economy. Stubbornly high prices have exacted a political toll on PresidentJoe Biden, whose approval rating has suffered in large part because of negative sentiment on how he has handled the economy.

With both the jobs picture and inflation softening, the central banks Federal Open Market Committee chose to lower its key overnight borrowing rate by a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, affirming market expectations that had recently shifted from an outlook for a cut half that size. Outside of the emergency rate reductions during Covid, the last time the FOMC cut by half a point was in 2008 during the global financial crisis. The decision lowers the federal funds rate to a range between 4.75%-5%. While the rate sets short-term borrowing costs for banks,it spills over into multiple consumer productssuch as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. In addition to this reduction, the committee indicated throughits dot plot the equivalent of 50 more basis points of cuts by the end of the year, close to market pricing. The matrix of individual officials expectations pointed to another full percentage point in cuts by the end of 2025 and a half point in 2026. In all, the dot plot shows the benchmark rate coming down about 2 percentage points beyond Wednesdays move. The decision to ease came in light of progress on inflation and the balance of risks. Notably, the FOMC vote was 11-1, with Governor Michelle Bowman preferring a quarter-point move. Bowmans dissent was the first by a Fed governor since 2005, though a number of regional presidents have cast no votes during the period. Trading was volatileafter the decision with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping as much as 375 points after it was released, before easing somewhat as investors digested the news and considered what it suggests about the state of the economy. Stocks ended slightly lower on the day while Treasury yields bounced higher. However, Powell and other policymakers in recent days haveexpressed concern about the labor market. While layoffs have shown little sign of rebounding, hiring has slowed significantly. In fact, the last time the monthly hiring rate was this low 3.5% as a share of the labor force the unemployment rate was above 6%. At his news conference following the July meeting, Powell remarked that a 50 basis point cut was not something were thinking about right now. For the moment, at least, the move helps settle a contentious debate over how forceful the Fed should have been with the initial move. With the Fed at the center of the global financial universe, Wednesdays decision likely will reverberate among other central banks, several of whom already have started cutting. The factors that drove global inflation higher were related mainly to the pandemic crippled international supply chains, outsized demand for goods over services, and an unprecedented influx of monetary and fiscal stimulus.

Still, there was widespread agreement that after reducing rates for three straight meetings, it was time to undertake a more deliberate approach to their key rate. Economists said the minutes strongly suggest that Fed officials will forego a rate cut at their next meeting in January. Fewer rate cuts will likely mean that borrowing costs for consumers and businesses including for homes, cars, and credit cards will remain elevated this year. Policymakers said that the Fed was at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing, the minutes said. In projections released after the meeting,Fed officials saidthey expect just two cuts next year, down from an earlier projection of four. The minutes also showed that almost all Fed policymakers see a greater risk than before that inflation could stay higher than they expect, in part because inflation has lingered in several recent readings and because of the likely effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy.

JY_Doc1_schools_possible_immigration_raids.txt,"Schools around the country are reviewing what to do if immigration agents come knocking as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office after campaigning on a pledge to deport millions of people. In several large cities, school systems are speaking up for the rights of immigrant students to attend school, regardless of whether they are in the country legally, and saying they would not assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In California, officials this week offered guidance to schools on state law limiting local participation in immigration enforcement. I know there is a lot of fear and anxiety around the incoming administration s anticipated changes to immigration policy, California Attorney General Bonta said, and I want to make sure students, their parents, and their teachers and school administrators are prepared. The 54-page California guide outlines state and federal protections for students and procedures for responding to law enforcement requests ranging from documents to interviews with students. Many communities debated how much and whether schools should cooperate with immigration authorities during Trump s first administration, when school systems including Chicago s took stands against immigration enforcement. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents have long abided guidance that deters arresting parents or students at schools and other sensitive locations that provide access to things like medical care and food and shelter. But Trump s re-election and campaign rhetoric on immigration policy have sparked discussions over whether those policies will stand. Although the protected area policy remains in effect ... it may be modified, superseded, or withdrawn at any time with little notice, the California guidance said. Because of this, and because exceptions to the policy exist, local educational agencies should have plans in place in the event that a law-enforcement officer requests information or access to a school site or a student for immigration-enforcement purposes. A Trump transition spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. An estimated 733,000 school-aged children are in the U.S. illegally, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Educators are acting at least in part to address the concerns of immigrant families and assure them their children are welcome and safe at school. We understand that fear and uncertainty, especially concerning the potential deportation of family members, can significantly impact our students well-being, their attendance, and their ability to learn, Des Moines, Iowa Public Schools, where one of four students are English language learners, said in a statement last month. The district affirmed a 2017 resolution limiting interactions with ICE officials to the superintendent. A resolution passed by Chicago Public Schools Board of Education in November said schools would not assist ICE in enforcing immigration law. Agents would not be allowed into schools without a criminal warrant, it said. And New York City principals last month were reminded by the district of policies including one against collecting information a student s immigration status. Vermont principal Chris Young said his district, whose students include children of migrant workers and farm workers, has a longstanding policy of requiring outside law enforcement to produce a warrant if they want access to students.

JY_Doc2_Potential_Shutdown_Education_Department.txt,"Incoming-President Donald Trump's second term is expected to have its share of shake-ups. Trump has promised to shut down several government agencies in an effort to reduce wasteful spending, which could have dramatic effects on the way government works. One of the agencies at risk is the United States Department of Education, which oversees and manages federal student loans and various programs that administer them. If the Education Department does go away, federal student loans will likely fall under the purview of a different government agency. While it's possible President-elect Trump could dismantle the Department of Education, doing so would necessitate a great deal of effort. Abolishing a government department requires an act of Congress, which means it would likely need bipartisan support.This also isn t the first time someone has attempted to put an end to the Department of Education. One of the most recent examples is H.R.899, To terminate the Department of Education, a bill introduced in February 2023 by Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY). Although the U.S. House of Representatives considered the bill, it hasn t made any progress. Without a government agency that focuses exclusively on education, what would happen to existing student loans? Unfortunately for borrowers, it s highly unlikely that the Trump administration would forget (or forgive) these debts altogether. If the Department of Education was dismantled, it's much more likely that an agency like the Department of Justice, Department of Labor, or Treasury Department could be put in charge of student loans. Of course, these agencies would likely need additional staff and support in order to take on the new workload.Borrowers repaying their student loans on income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are also right to worry about the future. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan is currently paused as we await a decision on its legality from the courts, but there s a good chance it will be struck down in the coming months. This would leave borrowers choosing from the IDR plans that are left, which may be overhauled or eliminated entirely after Trump takes office. However, a couple solutions for easing the burden of our student debt crisis have been floated by GOP leaders. For example, Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY) introduced the Affordable Loans for Students Act, which would cut interest rates for most federal student loans to 1%.Another bill, called the College Cost Reduction Act and introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC), would double the maximum Pell Grant award and prevent interest from capitalizing on student loans.

JY_Doc3_Trump_Harris_Different_Plans.txt,"Education in the U.S. is in a state of flux. The pandemic has left students across the country with learning gaps, especially in math and science. Teacher turnover is high, with some areas hit by staffing shortages. Schools are increasingly targeted in mass shootings and effectively segregated by race. Public schools face budget cuts and declining enrollment, while states across the country are allowing taxpayer dollars to fund private education instead. The two current presidential candidates propose two sharply different paths forward for the U.S. education system. Former president Donald Trump favors what s known as school choice, or privatization, and increasing government involvement in curriculum. Vice President Kamala Harris supports programs to address inequity across early childhood, K 12 and higher education. Here s how their policy proposals measure up. Trump s most eye-catching campaign promise has been to eliminate the Department of Education. We will drain the government education swamp and stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America s youth with all sorts of things that you don t want to have our youth hearing, he said at a September rally in Wisconsin. Eliminating the agency, which provides around 11 percent of public school funding nationwide, would require an act of Congress. Even if this were to happen, the Trump campaign has not clarified what it proposes to do with the Department s two biggest programs Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which collectively provide some $34 billion in funding to educate students from low-income families and those with disabilities, respectively. But Project 2025, a recently published conservative policy agenda that has many connections to Trump but is not formally associated with his campaign, proposes sending federal funding for Title I and IDEA to states as no-strings-attached block grants meaning states could use the funds however they choose. The project also calls for phasing out federal spending on Title I funding over a 10-year period. Upending Title I funding would have a very substantial effect on districts that have higher concentrations of poverty, says Mark Weber, a public school teacher and education policy analyst at the New Jersey Policy Perspective think tank. A big concern for me [is] that the kids who are already poorly served will fall further behind because there won t be anything that requires states to use the funding equitably, says Gloria Ladson-Billings, a professor emerita of education at the University of Wisconsin Madison.",Oppose,oppose
JY_Doc4_Project_2025_Attack_Education.txt,"Presidential campaigns rarely state their specific policy positions, often leaving voters to fill in the gaps. But the Heritage Foundation s Project 2025, written predominantly by high-level Trump aides, offers a uniquely detailed playbook of what a second Trump term would mean for each function of government. Among the most radical changes proposed are the alterations to K-12 education policy. Here, we focus on three of Trump s proposed areas of change that would dramatically reshape public education in the United States: eliminating the Head Start program, defunding Title I, and introducing culture war issues into classrooms. If implemented, these changes would hurt students, families, and educators from coast to coast. The Head Start program was created in 1965 as part of Lyndon Johnson s War on Poverty. Across its 59-year history, it has helped 39 million families and currently serves 833,000 children each year through comprehensive education, health care, nutrition, and family services for children living in poverty. Head Start recognizes that the first five years of a child s life are critical to their long-term development. When they are provided key services and support early on, children are more likely to lead productive and healthy lives and rely less on taxpayer-funded programs later in life. And beyond the long-term benefits, Head Start also provides immediate relief to lower-income families who spend as much 36% of their income on child care alone. Yet Trump s Project 2025 advocates for the complete elimination of the Office of Head Start and the Head Start program it administers. It claims that Head Start is fraught with scandal and abuse and that the program provides little or no long-term academic value for children. But the data show Head Start dramatically improves the lives of its participants. Children enrolled in Head Start are 40% more likely to finish college, 23% less likely to end up in poverty, and 27% less likely to depend on public assistance. In fact, the $12 billion spent on Head Start each year yields $84 billion in value as measured by increased earnings and decreased reliance on social services. Reduced poverty and higher educational attainment are hard to square with the claim that Head Start provides no long-term value for children. The sad irony is that if Trump wins and eliminates Head Start, it will be rural Republican districts who suffer most. Children in rural counties are 37% more likely to live in poverty than their urban counterparts, so they re more likely to rely on Head Start for child care and early childhood education. A study by the Center for American Progress found that a third of all rural child care centers are Head Start Programs. Often, Head Start is the only child care available for these families. Students in rural areas already lag their contemporaries across key education metrics, Trump s education cuts would only widen the gap.",Oppose,support

In fact, in every year of the Biden-Harris Administration, we have set a new all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment. This record-breaking enrollment is no accident, and due to this Administration s efforts to lower health care costs and make it easier to sign up for coverage. We also made health care more affordable for Americans purchasing their health insurance on the ACA Marketplace, saving consumers an average of $800 annually on their premiums. For example, this Administration made the largest ever investment in outreach and enrollment assistance, especially those in rural or underserved communities while at the same time eliminating bureaucratic red tape that makes it harder for people to enroll in coverage. But all of these efforts to lower health care costs and expand coverage are now in danger. If Republicans in Congress take away the enhanced premium tax credits that make ACA coverage more affordable, premiums will skyrocket and people will lose coverage. For many families the results will be catastrophic: A single parent earing $50,00 per year could see their premiums increase by $1600 per year. 2/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C... A retired couple earning $85,000 per year could see their premiums increase by $18,000 per year. Experts estimate that 3 to 5 million people would become uninsured. The Affordable Care Act Marketplaces are just one part of this Administration s commitment to health care coverage. Today, Medicaid covers about 80 million people. Thanks to the President s leadership, over one million Americans in four states now have Medicaid expansion coverage, driving total ACA-related enrollment to over 45 million. This Administration has also cut red tape to make applying for and renewing Medicaid coverage easier, and established new standards to ensure people have access to the care they need when they need it. In addition to today s record-breaking enrollment numbers, we are also releasing a report and a data chart pack detailing the Biden-Harris Administration s historic progress to improve the health of millions of Americans from making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, to tackling crises in mental health, maternal health, and more, and investing in public health infrastructure. Some highlights include: In its first year alone, President Biden s Medicare Drug Price Negotiation program outperformed expectations, achieving negotiated prices that are 38 to 79 percent lower than U.S. list prices for the ten first round negotiated drugs. These prices are $6 billion per year lower than what Medicare pays today and, once in effect, will put $1.5 billion dollars back into the pockets of Medicare beneficiaries. Seniors with Medicare are protected by the new $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs, and insulin is capped at just $35 per month. The Administration ended the family glitch, making millions of family members finally eligible for affordable ACA Marketplace coverage with about one million people projected to either gain coverage or have lower premiums. The 988 lifeline, created under this Administration, has answered more than 11 million calls, chats, and texts and made it easier for individuals experiencing distress to access immediate care. Following the Administration s efforts to reduce overdose deaths, recent data shows a 17% reduction in overdose deaths in the 12 months ending July 2024 compared to the prior year the largest decline in U.S. history. 3/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C...

SKSK_Doc2_ Biden-Lowers-Prescription-Drug.txt," FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health Care, and Protect Consumers The President believes that health care is a right, not a privilege, and since day one, he has delivered health care to millions more Americans while also lowering health care costs. The President continues to build on, strengthen, and protect Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act, signing laws such as the American Rescue Plan Act and the Inflation Reduction Act to lower prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums. Thanks to the President s efforts, more Americans have health insurance than under any other President, and are better protected against surprise medical bills and junk fees. Seniors are already seeing lower prescription drug prices with insulin capped at $35, free vaccines, and out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs capped at $2,000 starting in 2025. And the Administration is well on its way to lower the cost of range of drugs as Medicare negotiates over the prices of prescription drugs for the first time ever. The Biden-Harris Administration has also taken steps to make sure consumers aren t scammed by junk insurance and have better access to mental health care. However, the President is not just resting on these accomplishments. He s f ighting to deliver even lower costs and better health care to Americans. That s why the Biden-Harris Administration is acting to lower prescription drug costs, keep health insurance premiums low, expand access to health care, especially mental health care coverage, and continue to protect Americans from getting ripped off. Taking on Big Pharma to Deliver Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors and Families After decades of opposition, President Biden enacted a law that finally takes on Big Pharma and gives Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. President Biden s Inflation Reduction Act will save millions of seniors money on some of the costliest prescription drugs on the market. Meanwhile, Big 1/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... Pharma also executed over $135 billion in mergers and acquisitions in 2023 alone, while passing the cost to consumers. And eight of the 10 drugs selected for this year s negotiation program raised their prices drugs were already priced in 2024 after all 10 three to eight times higher in the United States than in other countries. President Biden knows how the Inflation Reduction Act is delivering for American families, and his Administration will continue the fight to lower health care costs for more Americans. Announcing that Manufacturers of 10 Drugs Remain at the Negotiating Table. Last month, for the first time in history, Medicare has made offers on the fair price for 10 of the most widely used and expensive drugs. Medicare is no longer taking whatever price for these drugs that the pharmaceutical companies demand. This week CMS announced that manufacturers for all 10 selected drugs are participating in drug price negotiation, with all manufacturers having submitted counteroffers and negotiations continuing. Later this year, new, negotiated prices for the first 10 prescription drugs selected for the negotiation program will be announced. Let Medicare Negotiate Drug Prices for at least 50 Drugs Every Year. Medicare should not be limited to negotiating just 20 drugs per year. Instead, the President is proposing that Medicare be able to negotiate prices for the major drugs that seniors rely on, like those used for treating heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. The Budget cuts federal spending by $200 billion increasing the number of drugs Medicare can select for negotiation and bringing more drugs into the negotiation process sooner, and other reforms. Expand Cap on Out-of-Pocket Prescription Drug Costs. When the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs applies in Medicare in 2025, nearly 19 million seniors and other beneficiaries are projected to save $400 per year on prescription drugs. The President is calling on Congress to expand the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap to all private insurance so that all Americans have the peace of mind that comes with knowing that they won t have to choose between filling their prescription or putting food on the table. Capping Medicare Cost-Sharing at $2 for Common Generic Drugs. Medicare will be launching a new model to limit Medicare Part D cost sharing for certain generic drugs to $2. As Medicare prepares to launch the model, HHS will publish a list of dozens of generic drugs for the model, including drugs like statins to treat high cholesterol, beta 2/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... blockers for high blood pressure, and platelet inhibitors to prevent blood clots. In his budget, the President is calling on Congress to limit Medicare cost-sharing to $2 for high-value generic drugs for all Medicare plans. Access to Cell & Gene Therapies. In January, HHS announced that sickle cell disease will be the first focus of the Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) Access Model. Under this model, CMS will negotiate with manufacturers on behalf of state Medicaid programs to increase affordable access to potentially lifesaving and life-changing treatment, and lower health care costs for some of the nation s most vulnerable populations. CMS will release the Request for Applications for drug manufacturers of cell and gene therapies to participate in the model. Expand the IRA s Requirement that Drug Companies Pay Rebates When They Increase Prices Faster than Inflation. Thanks to the IRA, drug manufacturers must now pay rebates to Medicare if their price increases for certain drugs exceed inflation. The President is calling on Congress to require those rebates for commercial drug sales, as well as sales to Medicare. That will save the federal government billions of dollars, further curb prescription drug price inflation, and reduce health insurance premiums for people with private health insurance coverage. Putting High-Quality Health Care Within Reach Today, more Americans have health insurance than under any President. The President s efforts to lower health insurance premiums have led to record breaking enrollment in the Affordable Care Act s Marketplaces, with over 21 million people signing up for coverage 9 million more than when the President took office. The Biden-Harris Administration isn t stopping there and is building on this incredible success by: Keeping Health Insurance Premiums Low. Thanks to the President s American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act, millions of Americans are saving on average $800 a year on premiums. The Biden Harris Administration is committed to keeping health insurance premiums low, giving families more breathing room and the peace of mind that health insurance brings. To do that, the President is calling on Congress to make the expanded premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act extended permanent. Without Congressional action, millions of Americans will see their health insurance premiums spike by hundreds or thousands of dollars starting in the fall of 2025. 3/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... Closing the Medicaid Coverage Gap. The President continues to call on Congress to provide Medicaid-like coverage to people in the 10 states that have not adopted Medicaid expansion as well as keeping Medicaid expansion enrollees covered. Keeping Kids Covered. Investing in our nation s children is a top priority for the President. Research shows that when children have health insurance, they thrive: they re healthier, they do better in school, and are more likely to succeed in adulthood. Keeping children covered is the right thing to do, which is why the President wants to make sure that children can never lose coverage due to red tape from birth until they turn age 6, and that families only have to submit Medicaid paperwork once every three years. Closing Research Gaps in Women s Health Research. In November 2023, the President and the First Lady launched the first-ever White House Initiative on Women s Health Research to fundamentally change how our nation approaches and funds women s health research. Women make up more than half the population but have been understudied and underrepresented in health research for far too long. Tonight, the President is calling on Congress to make a bold, transformative investment of $12 billion in new funding for women s health research. These investments will support a new fund at the National Institutes of Health to advance an interdisciplinary research agenda and create a new nationwide network of research centers of excellence and innovation in women s health. The Initiative will also catalyze private and philanthropic commitments to increase funding for women s health research. These new resources will make investments that maximize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women and ensure women get the answers they need when it comes to their health. Making Home Care More Available. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, President Biden delivered $37 billion to all states to expand access to home care and improve the quality of caregiving jobs. The Biden Harris Administration is taking steps to improve the quality of Medicaid home care services and to make sure home care workers get a bigger share of Medicaid payments for these critical services. The President remains committed to further improving and expanding Medicaid home care services, and is calling on Congress to do their part to allow the hundreds of thousands of older adults and individuals with disabilities on Medicaid home care waiting list to remain in their homes and stay 4/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... active in their communities while continuing to improve the quality of jobs for caregivers. Ensuring Access to Mental Health Care. Ensuring robust access to mental health care has been a bipartisan priority for almost 15 years, including the enactment of mental health parity requirements which require health plans to cover mental health care benefits at the same levels as physical health care benefits. Yet today, too many Americans still struggle to find and afford the care they need. The President is committed to tackling the mental health crisis in this country, which means making health plans do their part and providing agencies with the needed support to make sure they re doing so. The Biden-Harris Administration is working to finalize the mental health parity rule, which would close existing loopholes as well as ensure health plans evaluate access to mental health care in their networks, and make changes if it s found to be inadequate. In addition, the President is calling on Congress to further increase access to mental health care by expanding coverage in Medicare and private insurance, applying the mental health parity requirements to Medicare beneficiaries, and extending Medicare incentive programs to address mental health provider shortages. Cracking Down on Junk Insurance, Surprise Bills and Fees, and Confusing Health Care Pricing Nothing infuriates the President more than seeing Americans get ripped off. That s why the Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized implementing surprise billing protections, preventing 1 million Americans from receiving surprise medical bills every single month. The President has also taken steps to prevent Americans from being ripped off by junk insurance that preys on vulnerable citizens by closing loopholes to ensure consumers know what they re buying and can get the health coverage that best meets their needs. But more can be done to protect consumers, which is why the President intends to: Prevent More Surprise Medical Bills. Today, Americans are protected from receiving medical bills for most emergency care and air ambulance services as well as when consumers didn t know they were getting care from an out-of-network provider despite doing their homework and going to an in-network facility for treatment. The President wants to further protect consumers by applying surprise billing protections to 5/7 1/12/25, 9:00 PM FACT SHEET: President Biden Takes New Steps to Lower Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs, Expand Access to Health... ground ambulance providers. The last thing people should worry about during an emergency is an unexpected bill for their ambulance ride. Crack Down on Junk Insurance. Last year, the Biden-Harris Administration proposed a monumental rule to help millions of Americans access high-quality, affordable health insurance and protect consumers from being discriminated against because of pre-existing conditions. Making sure Americans aren t scammed into low-quality coverage, and charged more or denied life-saving care is a key priority for the Administration, which is why we are working to finalize proposed rules that limit the availability of junk insurance. Honoring America s Commitment to Seniors The President has always believed that Medicare and Social Security are a promise a rock-solid guarantee generations of Americans have counted on to be able to retire with dignity and security. The President will reject any efforts to cut the Medicare or Social Security benefits that seniors and people with disabilities have earned and paid into their entire working lives. The Budget honors that ironclad commitment not only by rejecting benefit cuts, but by embracing reforms and investments that will protect and strengthen both programs. The President is committed to working with Congress to ensure Medicare and Social Security remain strong for their beneficiaries, now and in the future. Securing Medicare. In his budget, the President is calling on Congress to ensure that high-income individuals contribute their fair share to Medicare and directs revenue from the Net Investment Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was originally intended. In addition, the President has proposed to direct savings from further lowering drug costs into the Medicare trust fund. If Congress were to heed the President s call and enact these reforms, it would substantially extend solvency for the Medicare HI Trust Fund, guaranteeing seniors the benefits they have been promised. Protects Seniors Health and Dignity. As President Biden pledged to do two years ago in the State of the Union, the Biden-Harris Administration is set[ting] higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and that they expect. The nursing home industry receives billions of dollars of taxpayer funding each year, but for too long, many facilities have not had the staff required to give residents safe, high-quality care.

The final rule was just submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review Strong Record on Expanding and Strengthening Health Care Nationwide The President s new actions are all in addition to an already impressive track record on fighting for the health care of Americans across the nation. Over the last three years, the President has: Expanded health insurance through the ACA Marketplaces to an additional nine million Americans and helped over one million people in Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Dakota gain Medicaid coverage. Extended postpartum Medicaid coverage to nearly 700,000 women across 44 states and the District of Columbia. Kept children covered continuously in Medicaid and CHIP for a full year. Made it easier for people to enroll in the ACA Marketplaces and Medicaid, including for older adults that are covered by both Medicaid and Medicare. Made critical vaccines free for all Medicare beneficiaries as well as adults enrolled in Medicaid, with seniors on Medicare saving on average $70 in out-of-pockets for vaccines. Lowered maximum out of pocket costs for Americans with employer and ACA coverage by an average of $400. Capped out-of-pocket costs at $35 for a month s supply of insulin for seniors and people with disabilities on Medicare.

SKSK_Doc4_ Biden-Harris-strengthening-healthcare-cybersecurity.txt,"FACT SHEET: Biden- Harris Administration Bolsters Protections for Americans Access to Healthcare Through Strengthening Cybersecurity Recent cyberattacks targeting the nation s healthcare system have demonstrated the vulnerability of our hospitals and payment systems. Providers across the health system had to scramble for funding after one attack on a key payment system. And some hospitals had to redirect care after another. These disruptions can take too long to resolve before full access to needed health care services or payment systems is restored. Cyberattacks against the American healthcare system rose . 128% from 2022 to 2023 In February and March of 2024 alone, the United States experienced one of the most significant healthcare-related cyberattacks to date. During the attack, providers reported that one out of every three health care claims in the United States were impacted, leading to disruptions in timely payment to healthcare providers. Recognizing that effective cybersecurity is critical to Americans accessing the care they need, the Biden-Harris Administration is working relentlessly to improve the resilience of the healthcare sector to cyberattacks. Many healthcare companies are private sector owned and operated, so private sector uptake and partnership is key to meaningful improvements in the sector s ability to withstand attacks. In January of 2024, the Department of Health and Human Services launched a healthcare cybersecurity gateway website to simplify access to the Department s healthcare-specific cybersecurity information and resources and published voluntary Healthcare and Public Health Cybersecurity Performance Goals designed to help healthcare institutions plan and prioritize high-impact cybersecurity practices. 1/3 1/12/25, 9:05 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Bolsters Protections for Americans Access to Healthcare Through Strengthening C... In May of 2024, the White House convened Chief Information Security Officers and other high-level executives from across the healthcare sector spanning care delivery organizations, medical technology companies, and industry associations to advance cybersecurity solutions across the industry. Participants shared their organization s views on cybersecurity challenges and the need to work together with government to better share threat intelligence and adopt secure-by design solutions for the technologies underpinning the healthcare system. In May of 2024, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) announced the launch of the Universal Patching and Remediation for Autonomous Defense (UPGRADE) program, a cybersecurity effort that will invest more than $50 million to create tools for information technology (IT) teams to better defend the hospital environments they are tasked with securing. Healthcare-related cyber disruptions can be particularly disruptive to rural hospitals, which serve over 60 million Americans. Most rural hospitals are critical access hospitals, meaning they are located more than 35 miles from another hospital, which makes diversions of patients and staffing-intensive manual workarounds in response to attacks more difficult. Recognizing the critical role these hospitals play in the communities they serve, the White House worked with and received commitments from leading U.S. technology providers to provide free and low-cost resources for all 1,800-2,100 rural hospitals across the nation. As part of this initiative to improve security and resilience of our rural hospital system, our private sector partners have committed to the following: For independent Critical Access Hospitals and Rural Emergency Hospitals, Microsoft is extending its nonprofit program to provide grants and up to a 75% discount on security products optimized for smaller organizations. For participating larger rural hospitals already using eligible Microsoft solutions, Microsoft is providing its most advanced security suite at no additional cost for one year.

The regulations, which could be issued as soon as Friday, would create three tiers of chip trade restrictions, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. At the top level, a small number of U.S. allies would maintain essentially unmitigated access to American chips. A group of adversaries, meanwhile, would be effectively blocked from importing the semiconductors. And the vast majority of the world would face limits on the total computing power that can go to one country. Countries in the last group would be able to bypass their national limits and get their own, significantly higher caps by agreeing to a set of U.S. government security requirements and human rights standards, one of the people said. That type of designation called a validated end user aims to create a set of trusted entities that develop and deploy AI in secure environments around the world. Shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of AI chips, dipped more than 1% in late trading after the plan was reported on. They had been up 4.3% this year through the close, following stratospheric gains in 2023 and 2024 that turned the company into the worlds most valuable chipmaker. Nvidia objected to the proposal in a statement. ""A last-minute rule restricting exports to most of the world would be a major shift in policy that would not reduce the risk of misuse but would threaten economic growth and U.S. leadership, Nvidia said. Every data center and business is already incorporating AI through what the company calls accelerating computing, Nvidia said. ""The worldwide interest in accelerated computing for everyday applications is a tremendous opportunity for the U.S. to cultivate, promoting the economy and adding U.S. jobs, the chipmaker said. The measures build on years of curbs that already limited the ability of American chipmakers such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell advanced processors in China and Russia. The U.S. also has sought to prevent adversary nations from accessing cutting-edge U.S. technology through intermediaries in places such as the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Data centers are strategically crucial because companies use them to develop and run AI models, sometimes across national borders. ",Neutral,oppose
YCK_Doc2_Blinken-Wang-discuss.txt,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated Washington's concerns over Beijing's actions toward Taiwan and its support for Russia's war in Ukraine as he met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Saturday. Blinken, who earlier called out China for escalating maritime tensions with the Philippines, talked extensively with Wang about Taiwan and Beijing's recent ""provocative"" actions toward the democratically governed island, a senior U.S. State Department official said. Those actions included a simulated blockade during the inauguration of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, the official said. Blinken and Wang agreed to keep making progress on their countries' military-to-military ties, but did not discuss nuclear arms control talks, which China has halted in protest over Washington providing arms to Taiwan, the official said. ""In every discussion, Taiwan is the issue that they care most about. They see it as ... an internal China issue,"" said the official, who briefed reporters travelling with Blinken. China's government considers Taiwan inviolable Chinese territory, which Taiwan rejects. Wang told Blinken that Taiwan was part of China and ""was not and will not be a country"", and Beijing would counter provocations by forces advocating Taiwan's independence, according to a foreign ministry statement. He said that though communication channels between China and the United States were open, Washington had intensified its efforts to contain and suppress Beijing. ""The risks facing Sino-U.S. relations are still accumulating and the challenges are rising and ties are at a critical juncture of halting their decline and achieving stability,"" Wang said. The two talked for one hour, 20 minutes on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos, in their sixth meeting since June 2023, when Blinken visited Beijing in a sign of improvement in strained relations between the world's two biggest economies. The two did not set a date for their next meeting, the official said. Blinken is touring East Asia in a bid to reassure countries close to China of U.S. commitment, despite political uncertainty at home. He travelled to Vietnam later on Saturday and was set to hold security talks alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Japan and the Philippines in the coming days. Blinken conveyed to Wang that U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, both believed in the importance of stability in the U.S.-China relationship, and that a rules-based order must be upheld, the official added. Blinken also discussed China's support for Russia's defence industrial base and warned of further U.S. actions if China does not curtail that, according to the official. Washington has levied sanctions at targets including China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of an effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine. ""There was no commitment by the Chinese to take action,"" the official said. Blinken also raised with Wang U.S. concerns over human rights in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet, and stressed the need for more progress from Beijing on counter narcotics including fentanyl precursors coming out of China.

YCK_Doc3_US-finalize-Chinese.txt,"President Joe Biden's outgoing administration plans to finalize rules next week cracking down on Chinese vehicle software and hardware, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters. In September, the department proposed prohibiting key Chinese software and hardware in connected vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns. That move would effectively bar Chinese cars and trucks from the U.S. market. Major global automakers would have to remove key Chinese software and hardware from vehicles sold in the U.S. in the years ahead. ""We wanted to hear from industry. We had to get it right. We digested all of that comment and now we're going to get this out,"" Raimondo said in an interview. ""It's really important because we don't want two million Chinese cars on the road and then realize... we have a threat."" The White House cleared the final rule late Tuesday, according to a government website. The proposal issued in September would make software prohibitions effective in the 2027 model year. The hardware ban would take effect in 2029. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab Toyota Motor (7203.T), opens new tab Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), opens new tab, Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), opens new tab and other major automakers, in October sought at least one additional year to meet the hardware requirement. The Consumer Technology Association said both deadlines should be extended by two years as did Honda Motor (7267.T), opens new tab in order ""to conduct crucial testing, validations, and updating of necessary contracts."" In September, the Biden administration locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles and hikes on EV batteries and key minerals. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, wants to prevent Chinese auto imports but has said he remains open to Chinese automakers building vehicles in the U.S. ""We're going to give incentives, and if China and other countries want to come here and sell the cars, they're going to build plants here, and they're going to hire our workers,"" Trump told Reuters.

YCK_Doc4_Zelenskyy-Austin-use.txt,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used their final meeting Thursday to press the incoming Trump administration not to give up on Kyivs fight, with Austin warning that to cease military support now will only invite more aggression, chaos and war. Weve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions weve created, Zelenskyy said. No matter whats going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased off the map. President-elect Donald Trumps pronouncements about pushing for a quick end to the war, his kinship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and uncertainty over whether he will support further military aid to Ukraine have triggered concern among allies. The Biden administration has worked to provide Ukraine with as much military support as it can, including approving a new $500 million package of weapons and relaxing restrictions on missile strikes into Russia, with the aim of putting Ukraine in the strongest position possible for any future negotiations to end the war. And while Austin acknowledged he has no idea what Trump will do, he said the international leaders gathered Thursday at Ramstein Air Base talked about the need to continue the mission. The leaders were attending a gathering of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, a consortium of about 50 partner nations that Austin brought together months after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 to coordinate weapons support. Im leaving this contact group not with a farewell but with a challenge. The coalition to support Ukraine must not flinch. It must not falter. And it must not fail, Austin said during his final press conference. Ukraines survival is on the line. But so is all of our security. Some discussed what they would do if the U.S. backed away from its support for Kyiv, if the contact group would assume a new shape under one of its major European contributors, such as Germany. Germanys Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said his country and several other European nations are discussing options. Austin said the continuation of the group is essential, calling it the arsenal of Ukrainian democracy and the most consequential global coalition in more than 30 years. President Joe Biden was to have his final face-to-face meeting with Zelenskyy in the coming days in Rome, but he canceled the trip because of the devastating fires in California. Pistorius said he intends to travel to the U.S. shortly after Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration to meet his new counterpart to discuss the issue. Its clear a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now, and it will require even more cooperation, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine has launched a second offensive in Russias Kursk region and is facing a barrage of long-range missiles and ongoing advances from Russia as both sides seek to put themselves in the strongest negotiating position possible before Trump takes office.

DR_Doc1_Paris_accord_withdrawal.docx,"Title: Why Trump s New Withdrawal from Paris Agreement Would Be Different Authors: Schonhardt, Sara Source/Date: Politico, November 10, 2024 URL: Keywords: Paris Agreement, Trump, withdrawal, climate, international Total Word Count: 1,396 Brief Summary: The article discusses Donald Trump s renewed intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement if he takes office in 2025. Unlike his first withdrawal in 2017, this move comes in a significantly different political and economic context, both domestically and internationally. The article explores how the global dynamics surrounding climate action have shifted since his initial term and what this could mean for U.S. environmental policy and global leadership. One key difference highlighted is the growing global consensus on the urgency of climate change. During Trump s first withdrawal, the Paris Agreement was still in its early stages, and many nations were still grappling with its implementation. Now, almost all signatories have made significant progress, and the U.S.'s absence would stand out more starkly as a deviation from the global effort to curb carbon emissions. Domestically, the landscape is also more complex. U.S. corporations, states, and cities have increasingly embraced renewable energy and climate action, often independently of federal policy. The economic appeal of renewable energy sources, which have become more cost-effective than fossil fuels in many cases, further complicates the narrative. Trump s focus on reviving the coal and oil industries could face resistance from these stakeholders, who see financial and reputational value in sustainability. Internationally, Trump s second withdrawal could erode trust in the United States as a reliable partner. The article notes that many nations see climate change as a global security issue, with significant economic and social implications. Repeatedly withdrawing and rejoining agreements like Paris could damage the U.S. s credibility in multilateral negotiations, not just on climate but on other critical global issues. The article also examines Trump s justification for the withdrawal, which centers on the idea that the Paris Agreement unfairly disadvantages the U.S. economy while letting other nations, particularly China and India, continue polluting at high levels. Trump has long argued that the agreement imposes burdens on American workers and businesses, a sentiment echoed by his political base. Critics of Trump s approach argue that withdrawing from the agreement is a short-sighted move that undermines the global fight against climate change. They stress that the U.S., as one of the largest historical emitters, has a moral and practical responsibility to lead by example. Ultimately, the article emphasizes that Trump s renewed withdrawal could have far-reaching consequences, not just for climate policy but for the U.S.'s standing on the world stage and its ability to shape the future of global cooperation.",Oppose,oppose
DR_Doc2_Offshore_Ban_Undo.docx,"Title: Biden Issues Ban on Offshore Oil and Gas Drilling in Most Federal Waters; Trump Vows to Undo It Authors: Daly, Matthew Source/Date: Associated Press, January 6, 2025 URL: Keywords: drilling, federal, ban, offshore, Trump Total Word Count: 532 Brief Summary: The article from the Associated Press examines President Joe Biden's recent executive action to ban offshore oil and gas drilling in most federal waters and former President Donald Trump s pledge to overturn this ban should he return to office in 2025. This move by Biden aims to safeguard marine ecosystems, combat climate change, and align the U.S. with its renewable energy and carbon reduction goals. The ban, part of Biden s broader climate strategy, applies to significant portions of federal waters, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and parts of the Arctic Ocean. It also includes expanded protections for areas near the Alaskan coastline and the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental advocates have praised the decision as a major step toward reducing the United States reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating the risks posed by oil spills and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the move has sparked intense criticism from fossil fuel interests, Republican lawmakers, and some industry groups. They argue that such restrictions will hurt the U.S. economy, increase energy costs, and threaten energy security by reducing domestic oil and gas production. Critics also highlight the potential for job losses in industries reliant on offshore drilling and related activities, particularly in states like Texas, Louisiana, and Alaska, where fossil fuel production contributes significantly to the economy. The article highlights Trump s contrasting vision, which prioritizes energy independence and economic growth through the expansion of fossil fuel production. During his previous term, Trump had rolled back numerous environmental regulations and encouraged drilling in federal waters. His pledge to undo Biden s ban reflects a broader effort to return to his administration s deregulatory agenda and promote the fossil fuel industry as a cornerstone of American energy policy. The tension between these opposing approaches underscores the ongoing debate over the United States energy future. Biden s administration aims to transition to cleaner energy sources while meeting climate targets. Conversely, Trump s rhetoric resonates with those advocating for a fossil fuel-driven energy strategy, citing immediate economic benefits and reduced reliance on foreign oil. The article also touches on the broader implications of the ban for climate policy and international relations. By limiting offshore drilling, Biden signals U.S. commitment to global efforts to combat climate change, potentially strengthening alliances with nations prioritizing renewable energy and carbon neutrality. However, the potential reversal of this policy under a Trump administration could weaken global confidence in the U.S. as a stable partner in climate agreements. In summary, Biden s offshore drilling ban and Trump s vow to repeal it epitomize the ideological divide between climate action and fossil fuel promotion, with significant environmental, economic, and geopolitical ramifications. The decision highlights the stakes of the 2024 election in shaping U.S. energy policy.",Neutral,oppose

The initiative, detailed in this article from the New York Post, underscores Trump's intention to focus on border security, energy production, and regulatory rollbacks. This ambitious blueprint reflects his administration s agenda to solidify conservative policy goals while dismantling key policies enacted under President Joe Biden. A centerpiece of the plan is energy policy, where Trump seeks to restore and expand fossil fuel production. His proposals include lifting restrictions on offshore oil drilling, expediting pipeline construction, and opening federal lands to energy exploration. By prioritizing energy independence, Trump aims to reduce reliance on foreign oil, lower energy costs for Americans, and stimulate economic growth in fossil fuel-dependent regions. His energy vision aligns with his broader deregulatory approach, which includes reversing Biden-era regulations on renewable energy incentives and environmental protections. Another major focus of Trump s plan is border security. His agenda includes reinstating policies like the Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly known as ""Remain in Mexico,"" and resuming construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. He also proposes tightening asylum rules and increasing enforcement against illegal immigration. These measures resonate with his political base, emphasizing a strong stance on immigration as a hallmark of his policy priorities. The article highlights Trump s strategy of using executive orders to bypass legislative gridlock. While executive orders provide a mechanism for swift action, they also invite criticism for undermining democratic processes and checks and balances. Opponents argue that relying on executive actions for significant policy changes may erode institutional stability and fail to address issues comprehensively. The energy and border security components of Trump s plan are complemented by proposals to dismantle federal agencies and reduce government spending. These include downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and scaling back federal oversight in areas like healthcare and education. Trump s plan reflects his administration s commitment to limiting federal power and emphasizing states rights, consistent with traditional conservative values. The article notes that while Trump s executive order strategy is ambitious, its success depends on political dynamics, legal challenges, and public reception. Critics contend that the plan could deepen polarization and weaken U.S. leadership in areas like climate change and human rights. In conclusion, Trump s 100-executive order plan represents a bold and comprehensive approach to implementing his vision for America. By focusing on energy independence, border security, and deregulation, the plan seeks to resonate with his base while setting a confrontational tone for his potential presidency. The proposed orders exemplify Trump s preference for direct, unilateral action to achieve policy goals.",Support,oppose

Under the conservative-led Project 2025 framework, Trump s proposals aim to weaken or dismantle the EPA by cutting staffing, reallocating responsibilities to state governments, and repealing key environmental protections. One of the primary components of Trump s plan involves reducing the EPA workforce. Currently employing approximately 14,000 staff, the agency could face dramatic reductions, with some projections estimating cuts of up to 50%. These staffing changes would limit the EPA s ability to enforce environmental regulations, monitor pollution, and conduct scientific research. Proponents argue that this would reduce government overreach and allow states to develop their own policies tailored to local needs. Critics, however, fear that states may lack the resources or political will to maintain rigorous environmental standards, leading to increased pollution and health risks. Another cornerstone of Trump s proposal is transferring much of the EPA s authority to individual states. The plan reflects the belief that states are better positioned to address regional environmental challenges. For example, permitting processes for industrial projects could be streamlined by eliminating federal oversight, which Trump and his supporters claim slows economic growth and burdens businesses. However, environmental advocates warn that this approach could lead to inconsistent regulations, creating a ""race to the bottom"" as states compete to attract industry by lowering environmental standards. Trump s agenda also targets key policies enacted under the Biden administration, including regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy incentives, and protections for water and air quality. Trump has long argued that such policies impose unnecessary business costs and hinder economic growth. The plan calls for rescinding rules tied to the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule, both seen as cornerstones of federal environmental policy. Project 2025 outlines broader goals beyond the EPA, including reorganizing other federal agencies and shifting their missions away from climate change and environmental justice. For instance, the Department of the Interior could prioritize fossil fuel development on federal lands, aligning with Trump s energy independence agenda. While supporters of these changes argue they will boost economic productivity and reduce regulatory burdens, opponents contend that downsizing the EPA could have long-term consequences for public health, climate change mitigation, and global environmental leadership. Legal challenges are also expected, as many of the proposed changes would face resistance from environmental groups and Democratic-led states. In summary, Trump s plan to shrink the EPA embodies his administration s commitment to deregulation, economic growth, and state autonomy, but it raises significant concerns about the future of environmental protection and federal oversight in the United States.",Oppose,support

But Trump s intent to quickly unban any future oil and gas drilling in those areas may not be as simple as he suggests. That s because Biden issued his ban using authority granted to presidents by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, a 1953 law that allows presidents to protect unleased lands of the outer continental shelf from oil and gas development. In 2019, a federal judge ruled that any such prohibition could be overturned by Congress but not a future president. Here, we ll explain what Biden did and how Trump may be able to stop it. Biden took executive action on Jan. 6 to protect much of the U.S. coastline from more exploratory drilling. He issued two presidential memorandums that withdrew more than 625 million acres of coastal waters from potentially being leased for new oil and natural gas production. The areas covered by the actions are the eastern U.S. Atlantic coast; the eastern Gulf of Mexico; the Pacific Coast along California, Oregon and Washington; and portions of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. States have rights to the resources in the area that is three nautical miles, or more in some cases, from their coastlines, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. But the federal government has jurisdiction over the outer continental shelf, which extends beyond the state jurisdiction. Biden acted using the authority granted to presidents under section 12(a) of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and this is not the first time that he has done so. Biden previously used his authority in January 2021, to protect part of the Northern Bering Sea, and in March 2023, he withdrew nearly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea in the U.S. Arctic Ocean from future oil and gas drilling. In 2020, Trump, citing the same law as Biden, issued his own presidential memorandum making parts of the coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina unavailable to be leased until 2032. With Biden s recent actions, the White House said the president has now conserved more than 670 million acres of U.S. federal land and waters. After Biden s ban was announced this month, Trump said that he would quickly end it. But he may not be able to do so on his own. In fact, in 2017, Trump was unsuccessful in trying to reverse bans on new drilling in parts of the Arctic Ocean that were implemented by President Barack Obama. Trump issued an executive order to undo Obama s bans, but in 2019, a federal district judge in Alaska, Sharon Gleason, an Obama appointee, ruled that Trump s order was unlawful and invalid because the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act does not allow a president to repeal a withdrawal made by another president. The Trump administration appealed the decision, but a higher court never weighed in before Biden took office in January 2021 and revoked Trump s executive order. After Biden s revocation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit dismissed the case as moot. This time, Trump could issue another executive order and hope that it survives a legal challenge. Another option is for Trump to work with the Republican-controlled Congress on legislation that would amend Biden s ban or rescind it. In her email, Wiseman noted that Gleason s 2019 ruling said that Congress could override a leasing ban by either revoking the withdrawal itself ... or amending Section 12(a) to expressly provide that a future President could also revoke a prior presidential withdrawal. The reconciliation process would allow the Senate to pass a bill with a simple majority instead of the 60 votes required to stop a potential filibuster.",Neutral,oppose
GKF_Doc1_Trudeau-says-not.docx,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has hit back at Donald Trump's threat to use ""economic force"" to absorb Canada into the US saying there isn't ""a snowball's chance in hell"" to join the two. President-elect Trump has in recent weeks repeatedly needled Canada about it becoming the 51st US state. ""You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security,"" Trump said at a press conference at his Florida Mar-a Lago home on Tuesday. ""Canada and the United States, that would really be something."" Trump reiterated his threat to bring in a ""substantial"" tariff on Canadian goods unless the country took steps to increase security on the shared US border. The ongoing tariff threat comes at a politically challenging time for Canada. On Monday, an embattled Trudeau announced he was resigning, though he will stay on as prime minister until the governing Liberals elect a new leader, expected sometime by late March. Canada's parliament has been prorogued - or suspended - until 24 March to allow time for the leadership race. Economists warn that if Trump follows through on imposing the tariffs after he is inaugurated on 20 January, it would significantly hurt Canada's economy. Almost C$3.6bn ($2.5bn) worth of goods and services crossed the border daily in 2023, according to Canadian government figures. The Trudeau government has said it is considering imposing counter-tariffs if Trump follows through on the threat. The prime minister also said on X on Tuesday that: ""Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other's biggest trading and security partner."" During his lengthy Mar-a-Lago press conference, Trump reiterated his concerns he has expressed about drugs crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada into the US. Like Canada, Mexico faces a 25% tariff threat. The amount of fentanyl seized at the US-Canada border is significantly lower than at the southern border, according to US data. Canada has promised to implement a set of sweeping new security measures along the border, including strengthened surveillance and adding a joint ""strike force"" to target transnational organised crime. Trump said on Tuesday he was not considering using military force to make Canada part of the United States, but raised concerns about its neighbour's military spending. ""They have a very small military. They rely on our military. It's all fine, but, you know, they got to pay for that. It's very unfair,"" he said. Canada has been under pressure to increase its military spending as it continues to fall short of the target set out for Nato members. Its defence budget currently stands at C$27bn ($19.8bn, 15.5bn), though the Trudeau government has promised that it will boost spending to almost C$50bn by 2030. British Columbia Premier David Eby told a news conference on Tuesday that a number of Canadian provincial premiers will soon be travelling to Washington DC to lobby against the possible tariffs. On Monday, Doug Ford, the leader of Canada's most populous province Ontario, said Trudeau must spend his remaining weeks in office working with the provinces to address Trump's threat. ""The premiers are leading the country right now,"" he told BBC News in an interview. Ontario has a deep reliance on trade with the US. The province is at the heart of the highly integrated auto industry in Canada, and trade between Ontario and the US totalled more than C$493bn ($350bn) in 2023. ""My message is let's work together, let's build a stronger trade relationship - not weaken it,"" Ford said. Reuters The premier warned ""we will retaliate hard"" if the Trump administration follows through, and highlighted the close economic ties between the two nations, including on energy. The US relies ""on Ontario for their electricity. We keep the lights on to a million and a half homes and businesses in the US"", he said. At a press conference early this week, Ford also pushed back on Trump's 51st state comments. ""I'll make him a counter-offer.

GKF_Doc2_Trump-Floats-Using.docx,"Trump Floats Using Force to Take Greenland and the Panama Canal In an hourlong news conference at his Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect delivered a hodgepodge of grievances, complaints and false claims. President-elect Donald J. Trump refused on Tuesday to rule out the use of military or economic coercion to force Panama to give up control of the canal that America built more than a century ago and to push Denmark to sell Greenland to the United States. In a rambling, hourlong news conference, Mr. Trump repeatedly returned to the theme of American sacrifice in building the canal and accused China, falsely, of operating it today. When pressed on the question of whether he might order the military to force Panama to give it up in violation of treaties and other agreements reached during the Carter administration or to do the same with Greenland, he said: No, I can t assure you on either of those two. We need them for economic security the Panama Canal was built for our military, he said. Asked again if he would rule out the use of military force, he said: I m not going to commit to that. You might have to do something. Mr. Trump s statements propelled his repeated calls for expanding American territory to a new level, one that is bound to roil three American allies Panama; Denmark, which handles Greenland s foreign and security affairs; and Canada, which he has mocked as America s 51st State. On Tuesday he made clear, though, that he was not joking, suggesting that if Canada remained a sovereign state the financial cost to its trading relationship with the United States could be crushing. Perhaps Mr. Trump was posturing, for negotiating advantage. Yet not since the days of William McKinley, who engaged in the Spanish-American War in the late 19th century and ended up with U.S. control of the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico, has an American president-elect so blatantly threatened the use of force to expand the country s territorial boundaries. It was a reminder that Mr. Trump s definition of America First is anything but isolationist. He comes to American foreign policy with the mind of a real estate developer, with a penchant for grabbing territory. He insisted he would not be deterred by the treaty signed with Panama, which was ratified by the Senate in 1978 by 68 to 32, just beyond the two-thirds vote required by the constitution. He asserted that the return of control of the Canal to Panama was a bad idea arguing that he was reluctant to say so while the nation was burying former President Jimmy Carter, who negotiated the deal. He then returned, repeatedly, to criticizing Mr. Carter s judgment. He was a very fine person, Mr. Trump said. But that was a big mistake, he added. It cost us the equivalent of a trillion dollars. On Canada, Mr. Trump, when pressed, threatened to use economic force, not the military, to join Canada and the United States together, implying that the United States would pare back its purchases of Canadian products. He declared he would use tariffs to hamper Canada s ability to assemble cars and sell them in the United States, and then charged that Canada contributed insufficiently to American defenses. He made no reference to NORAD, the combined American and Canadian defensive effort that is considered a military model for an interoperable, joint military early-warning system, run equally by two allies. It is at the core of American air and missile defense. He continued his push on Tuesday evening, posting maps on social media showing Canada as part of the United States. He also said at the news conference that he would tariff Denmark at a very high level if it did not give Greenland to the United States, before casting doubt on whether Denmark has a legitimate claim to Greenland at all. The threats, vague and unformed as they may be, were only part of the series of declarations Mr. Trump made about his plans when he takes office in less than two weeks. He said the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America, though it was unclear how serious he was about the effort. He declared that members of NATO, who were slow to fulfill a commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, should now prepare for a world in which they needed to spend 5 percent. They can all afford it, but they should be at 5 percent, not 2 percent, he said, before again threatening to not defend any NATO ally who did not, in his view, pay into the system sufficiently. Mr. Putin has used such threats in the past to sow divisions within NATO, an alliance he has been loath to take on directly even as it helps arm Ukraine. Mr. Trump s critique of NATO isn t a solitary one: Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Biden have all pressed the case, and the most progress in meeting the 2 percent goal has come in Mr. Biden s term, a fact he celebrated at the NATO summit in Washington in July during the 75th anniversary of the alliance. And even some European leaders, when speaking privately, say they agree that the goal should be moved to 3 percent if Europe is going to have any hope of assembling the military might to deter Russia in coming decades. They often add that there is no political constituency for spending at that level. But they may be driven there by necessity if they become convinced that the United States will not come to their aid. I would have loved to say yes, we ll protect you even if you don t pay, but that not the way life works, Mr. Trump told reporters. Mr. Trump also reiterated his threat that all hell will break out in the Middle East if the hostages being held by Hamas are not released by Inauguration Day, repeating the threat four times. But it was Mr. Trump s views on American territorial expansionism that were most striking in the news conference, and so untethered from international law. Image In December, when Mr. Trump ramped up his calls for the purchase of Greenland and voiced his complaints about how American shipping was treated as it traversed the Panama Canal, Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group noted that the case Mr. Trump was making had echoes of the justifications President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia made for invading Ukraine. But piecing together Mr. Trump s series of social media posts on these issues, and hearing his complaints at his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, one thing is clear: He is building a national security case for why an American takeover of Greenland and the Panama Canal Zone is necessary. He noted on Tuesday that Chinese and Russian ships were appearing around Greenland, an apparent showing of the countries growing interest in shorter polar shipping and military routes after global warming loosened and shrank ice fields, making them more passable. He argued that China, which controls two ports near the canal, was operating the canal itself; it is not. After Mr. Trump responded to the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday by writing on social media that many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State, Mr. Bremmer noted in a post on X that American imperialism is so back. In fact, it often sounded that way at the news conference, as Mr. Trump dismissed the declarations of Denmark s leadership that Greenland is not up for sale, and similar comments from Panama. The only question now is whether he is increasing the pressure for negotiating purposes, or would actually make good on his threats.",Oppose,oppose
GKF_Doc3_Why-Does-Trump.docx,"Why Does Trump Want the Panama Canal? Here s What to Know. President-elect Donald J. Trump on Tuesday refused to rule out using military force to retake the Panama Canal, which was returned by the U.S. to that country s control decades ago. Last month, Mr. Trump falsely accused Panama of allowing Chinese soldiers to control the vital shipping route, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and of overcharging American ships. He has also claimed Panama charges U.S. vessels exorbitant prices, and warned that if they are not reduced after he takes office next month, he will demand that the United States be granted control of the canal in full, quickly and without question. While it is unclear what prompted Mr. Trump s recent obsession with the Panama Canal, some Republicans have long objected to a decades-old treaty that turned the shipping lane over to Panamanian control. When Ronald Reagan ran for president, he said the people of the United States were the canal s rightful owners and brought audiences to their feet with the line: We bought it; we paid for it; we built it. The U.S. government managed the Panama Canal for decades after it was completed in the early 20th century. After a failed attempt by the French to construct a canal, it was ultimately built by the United States between 1904 and 1914. And the U.S. government managed the canal for several decades. The U.S. also played a role in the creation of the state of Panama. At the beginning of the 20th century, the isthmus of Panama was part of Colombia. When Colombia rejected a proposed canal treaty, the U.S. government encouraged a rebellion. Colombia s northern provinces eagerly seceded, forming the Republic of Panama. The United States Navy then kept Colombian troops from suppressing the rebellion. U.S. control of the canal created significant tensions with Panama. In 1964, anti-American riots broke out in the U.S.-controlled canal zone. The riots led to the renegotiation of the Panama Canal treaties. In 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the Panamanian leader Omar Efrai n Torrijos signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. The agreements guaranteed the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal. After a period of joint custody, the treaties called for the United States to relinquish control over the canal by the year 2000. Panama took full control in 1999, and has since operated the canal through the Panama Canal Authority. Mr. Carter, who died on Dec. 29, always considered the treaties to be signature achievements, and they figured prominently in his obituary. Through a bizarre accident of timing, we now have one president fantasizing about taking back the canal at just the time the world recognizes the canal transfer as an important part of a late president s legacy, said James Fallows, who was Mr. Carter s speechwriter at the time and accompanied the president on that 1978 trip to Panama. How has Panama responded? In a statement of rebuke to Mr. Trump last month, President Jose Rau l Mulino of Panama wrote every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent area belong to PANAMA. Mr. Mulino also said U.S. vessels are not being overcharged. Rates being charged to ships and naval vessels, he insisted, are not on a whim. Panamanian officials said all countries are subject to the same fees, though they would differ based on ship size. They are established in public meetings by the Panama Canal Authority, and take into account market conditions, international competition, operating and maintenance costs, Mr. Mulino said. Rates have gone up recently, however. That s because starting in 2023, Panama experienced severe drought, driven by a combination of El Nin o and climate change, which Mr. Trump has called a hoax. With water levels at Gatun Lake, the principal hydrological reserve for the canal, at historically low levels, authorities reduced shipping through the canal to conserve the lake s fresh water. A Trump spokeswoman said that because the United States is the biggest user of the canal, the increase in fees hits its ships the most. Chinese soldiers are not, as Mr. Trump has claimed, operating the Panama Canal. There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God, Mr. Mulino said in a speech Thursday. The world is free to visit the canal. A Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchison Holdings, does manage two ports at the canal s entrances. And some experts have said that does raise valid competitive and security concerns for the United States. Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, noted that CK Hutchison would likely have data on all ships coming through the Panama Canal. China has been using its shipping and maritime operations to gather foreign intelligence and conduct espionage. China exercises, or could exercise, a certain element of control even absent some military conflagration, Mr. Berg said. I think there is reason to be worried. Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said Tuesday that China will as always respect Panama s sovereignty over the Panama Canal. China is the second-largest user of the Panama Canal after the United States. In 2017, Panama cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognized the island as part of China, a major win for Beijing. Can the United States reassert control? Not easily. Mr. Mulino has made clear the Panama Canal is not for sale. He noted that the treaties established permanent neutrality of the canal and guaranteeing its open and safe operation for all nations. And the Senate ratified the Panama Canal treaties in 1978. Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump s former chief of staff, suggested that the provocations were merely part of a negotiating tactic to get rates down. You know, I don t envision American troops going in to retake the canal, but you got to think that someone is out there scratching their head going, Is Donald Trump crazy enough to do something like that? Mr. Mulvaney said Tuesday on The Hill on NewsNation. Mr. Berg said the neutrality agreement made it unlikely that Panama would even be able to grant special rates to the United States. And, he noted, Mr. Mulino is incredibly pro-American and likely eager to help the incoming Trump administration deal with issues like illegal immigration. President Mulino is going to be a great ally with the United States, Mr. Berg said. We should not want this to devolve into some kind of political fight because we re going to need President Mulino on a number of other issues. But there is, as Mr. Trump has threatened, a military option. Mr. Trump could as president order an invasion of Panama. Under the terms of its constitution, Panama has no army. But experts dismissed Mr. Trump s threat on Tuesday as empty intimidation. If the U.S. wanted to flout international law and act like Vladimir Putin, the U.S. could invade Panama and recover the canal, said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center s Latin America Program in Washington. No one would see it as a legitimate act, and it would bring not only grievous damage to their image, but instability to the canal. ",Oppose,support
GKF_Doc4_Trump-Threatens-Panama.docx,"Trump Threatens Economic Force to Make Canada 51st State It no longer sounds like a joke. US President-elect Donald Trump escalated his remarks about making Canada part of the US during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Tuesday. And he reiterated that he intends to put substantial tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico. Asked if he would use military force to annex Canada, he replied no economic force. Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially-drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security don t forget, we basically protect Canada. Trump claimed the US is subsidizing Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year, an apparent reference to the US trade deficit and possible other factors. The total US trade deficit in goods and services with Canada was $40.6 billion in 2023, according to US Census Bureau data. It s driven by energy exports: the US buys more than 4 million barrels a day of Canadian crude oil during some months. Trump s latest provocation prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to respond on X: There isn t a snowball s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States. More than 80% of Canadians are opposed to the idea, according to a recent poll. Members of Trudeau s government had previously played off the 51st state remarks as a joke. Trump said the US doesn t need anything that Canada produces. He said he d rather make cars in Detroit instead of relying on the highly-integrated continental auto supply chain, and not buy Canadian lumber or dairy. When discussing lumber, Trump said he could use an executive order to un-restrict it, implying the US could ramp up domestic supply. They should be a state, that s what I told Trudeau when he came down, Trump said, an apparent reference to a dinner meeting at Mar-a-Lago between him and the Canadian prime minister in late November. The US currently relies on Canada for a number of key commodities. In response to threats from Trump of 25% tariffs, officials in Ottawa have been examining the use of export taxes on items such as uranium, oil and potash as potential responses in case there s a trade war, Bloomberg News reported last month. Canadians Don't Want to Be the 51st State The Canadian dollar has dropped versus the greenback since Trump made a threat on Nov. 25 to put the tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The loonie was down 0.19% to C$1.4360 per US dollar as of 4:29 p.m. in New York. Trudeau announced his resignation on Monday, saying he doesn t have enough support from within his Liberal Party to lead it into an election this year.",Neutral,oppose
NC_Doc1.docx,"Trump will not rule out force to take Panama Canal, Greenland By Steve Holland and Joseph Ax January 8, 202510:24 AM CST PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump refused on Tuesday to rule out using military or economic action to pursue acquisition of the Panama Canal and Greenland, part of a broader expansionist agenda he has promoted since winning the Nov. 5 election. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, also floated the idea of turning Canada into a U.S. state, said he would demand far higher defense spending from NATO allies and promised to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Still two weeks away from taking office, Trump has begun outlining an aggressive foreign policy with little regard to diplomatic considerations or the concerns of U.S. allies. Asked at a press conference at his Florida resort whether he could assure the world he would not use military or economic coercion as he tries to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, Trump said, ""No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security."" Trump criticized American spending on Canadian goods and military support for Canada, saying the U.S. derives no benefits from doing so, and called the border between the two countries an ""artificially drawn line."" He suggested he would impose tariffs on Denmark if it resists his offer to purchase Greenland, which he said is vital to U.S. national security. Shortly before Trump's comments, his son Don Jr. arrived in Greenland for a private visit. Denmark has said Greenland, a self-governing part of its kingdom, is not for sale. ""I don't think it's a good way forward to fight each other with financial means when we are close allies and partners,"" Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late on Tuesday in response to Trump's comments. CANADA SAYS: 'WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN' Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Melanie Joly, said on X, ""President-elect Trump's comments show a complete lack of understanding of what makes Canada a strong country. Our economy is strong. Our people are strong. We will never back down in the face of threats."" Panama's top diplomat also pushed back on the incoming U.S. leader's threat to retake the key global waterway, which the U.S. had built and owned before handing over control to the Central American nation in 1999. ""The only hands that control the canal are Panamanian and that's how it will continue to be,"" Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters on Tuesday. Ambassador Daniel Fried, a retired U.S. diplomat now with the Atlantic Council think tank, said Trump's comments painted a picture of national power as territorial expansion and compared him to a ""19th century imperialist."" Seizing Greenland, Fried said, ""would destroy NATO, because it would make us no different than Vladimir Putin,"" Russia's president. Trump's promise to rename the Gulf of Mexico echoed his previous vow to revert the name of Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. Former President Barack Obama changed the name of the Alaskan mountain in deference to Native Americans. Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who is expected to play a key role in looming U.S.-Mexico trade issues, appeared to dismiss Trump's call to rename the shared body of water later on Tuesday. ""Today I'd tell you if we saw each other in 30 years, the Gulf of Mexico will still be called the Gulf of Mexico,"" he said, adding that the Mexican government would not get drawn into the debate. Typically, the U.S. Board of Geographic Names sets geographic names, though presidents have also renamed geographic features via executive action. Trump said NATO members should spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense, a significant increase from the current 2% target. ""I think NATO should have 5%,"" he said. ""They can all afford it, but they should be at 5%, not 2%."" Trump has frequently complained that most NATO members are not paying their fair share, and he floated demanding an increase in NATO defense contributions during the campaign. NATO estimated that 23 of its 32 members would meet its goal of spending 2% of GDP in 2024. None of the alliance members, including the U.S., currently spends 5% of GDP on defense, according to NATO figures. Poland is the highest spender in GDP terms at 4.12%, followed by Estonia at 3.43% and the United States at 3.38%. Trump also repeated his threat that ""all hell will break out in the Middle East"" if Palestinian Hamas militants do not release by the time he takes office hostages it abducted from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and still hold in the Gaza Strip. ""It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,"" he said. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, told reporters he hopes to have good things to report on negotiations between Israel and Hamas by the time Trump is sworn into office. FAMILIAR GRIEVANCES The free-wheeling, hour-long press conference, Trump's second since his victory, echoed similar events during his presidential campaign. He aired a series of familiar grievances about his criminal indictments, including attacking Justice Juan Merchan, the New York judge who is scheduled to sentence Trump on Friday for falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn star. A New York appeals court denied his latest bid to halt the sentencing shortly after his press conference ended. Separately, as Trump was speaking, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigations into Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The judge, Aileen Cannon, had previously dismissed the case charging Trump with illegally retaining classified materials after leaving office. Tuesday's event took place in the ornate living room at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach resort. Several of Trump's senior advisers watched the proceedings, while club guests could be seen outside dining on the terrace. Trump was also asked whether it was appropriate for Elon Musk to publicly weigh in on foreign affairs. In recent weeks, the billionaire Trump ally has used his X platform to comment on European politics, including expressing support for Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany. ""I can say Elon is doing a good job, very smart guy,"" Trump said. ""I don't know the people you're talking about.""",Oppose,oppose
NC_Doc2.docx,"The Biden Administration Pursues Last-Minute Diplomacy With India In New Delhi, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan seeks to foolproof some elements of the partnership. By Michael Kugelman, the writer of Foreign Policy s weekly South Asia Brief and the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. Jake Sullivan Visits New Delhi U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other top officials in New Delhi on Jan. 6. Sullivan s visit came on the heels of Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar s trip to the United States last December, which featured meetings with senior officials and lawmakers. This flurry of high-level diplomacy at the tail end of U.S. President Joe Biden s term highlights the depth of the U.S.-India partnership as well as some shakiness as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time. By visiting India just two weeks before the end of the Biden era, Sullivan sent a strong message. In a speech at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Sullivan said that this overseas trip marked his last as national security advisor. I cannot think of a better way to end my tenure in the White House visiting India ... to mark the advances we have made together, he said, mentioning achievements in defense and technology cooperation. Sullivan also announced that obstacles preventing the full implementation of a 2008 civil nuclear agreement long envisioned as a cornerstone of U.S.-India cooperation will soon be removed. There is strong bipartisan support in Washington for partnership with India, especially because of its envisioned role helping the United States counter China. Trump will undoubtedly support this position. Still, Sullivan s trip also hinted at possible concerns about momentum in the relationship amid the U.S. leadership transition. The visit can be read in part as an effort to foolproof what both sides regard as a signature achievement of bilateral cooperation during the Biden era: the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), which was a major focus of Sullivan s meetings in New Delhi. The initiative has inspired collaborations on defense, space, and artificial intelligence. Significantly, iCET is led by both countries national security advisors, which reduces the risk of it getting bogged down by bureaucracy. But this advantage could become a vulnerability with a leadership change. Trump will support technology collaborations with India, especially if they relate to countering China. But he has previously taken a hard line on export controls and threatened to impose tariffs on India both of which could constrain tech cooperation. Sullivan s discussions in India likely touched on how to ensure that iCET can withstand any resistance from the next administration. Likewise, Jaishankar probably used his meeting with Rep. Mike Waltz, Trump s pick for national security advisor, to reinforce the importance of iCET. The initiative may not be the only Biden-era achievement that Washington and New Delhi are looking to safeguard: Sullivan said that he was in touch with Trump s team about the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, a connectivity initiative that was announced in 2023. Finally, both Sullivan and Jaishankar s visits probably focused on one of the biggest tension points between the United States and India: the U.S. Justice Department case against an Indian national accused of a failed assassination plot against a Sikh activist and U.S. citizen in New York on behalf of New Delhi. The White House has sought India s cooperation in the U.S. investigation through India s own inquiry committee; Sullivan has reportedly been a lead interlocutor. The issue likely figured into many of his engagements in New Delhi and his meeting with Jaishankar in Washington. The U.S.-India relationship will have a relatively easy transition to Trump s second term, thanks to the many areas of cooperation publicly celebrated during the Jaishankar and Sullivan visits. But that heady rhetoric hides the hard work that remains. Eleventh-hour diplomacy is likely intended to help ease the burden. What We re Following Opposition negotiations underway in Pakistan. Pakistani officials have begun talks with leaders from jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after months of tensions and government crackdowns on the party and its supporters. Khan has been in jail since August 2023 on charges that his supporters denounce as politically motivated. The decision to hold talks is encouraging: There has been little dialogue between the two sides since Khan was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in 2022. Violent protests targeting military facilities after his arrest in 2023, an election last year criticized for irregularities, a crackdown against PTI protesters in November, and military court convictions of political protesters in December have further inflamed the political environment. Khan likely agreed to talks because the PTI is in a tough spot. The November protests in Islamabad achieved little, and divides are growing among the party leaders who are not in jail. But the discussions have made little progress so far. The PTI s main demands are that its supporters be released from jail and for independent investigations into the 2023 protests targeting military facilities (which the PTI says that it was not involved with) and the November crackdown in Islamabad. The party has also called for unfettered access to Khan to discuss its negotiating strategy. Of course, its most important demand is the release of Khan. Pakistan s military leadership may be open in principle to a deal that would free him. But it would likely condition such a move on Khan going into exile or pledging to stay quiet neither of which he would agree to. Ideally, each side would make a gesture of good will to provide a more conducive environment for talks, but in the current climate, that might be asking for too much. India-Canada rapprochement? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s impending resignation may clear a path for New Delhi to ease deep tensions with Ottawa. Relations are in deep crisis over Canadian allegations that the Indian government is sponsoring campaigns against Sikh separatists in Canada, including a 2023 assassination in British Columbia. Meanwhile, India contends that Canada is coddling extremists who call for the establishment of a Sikh state in India known as Khalistan. Indian officials view Sikh separatists as dangerous terrorists. New Delhi has singled out Trudeau for the diplomatic crisis its only major tensions with a Western state and accuses him of appealing to Sikh separatists for political reasons. Trudeau s departure certainly isn t guaranteed to stabilize the free-falling relationship with India. Canada s investigations will continue under the next prime minister, which could bring fresh public allegations against India to light. And domestic political factors in Canada including powerful Sikh constituencies suggests that Trudeau-era policies won t necessarily change. Canadian opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, who may become the next prime minister, has criticized the rhetoric and actions of Sikh separatists in Canada but some Indian commentators say that he hasn t gone far enough. Still, the leadership transition provides an opportunity for a fresh start for New Delhi. Tibet earthquake felt in South Asia. A massive earthquake that struck Tibet on Jan. 7 affected a few South Asian states. The epicenter was near the border with Nepal, and Kathmandu residents reported shaking in their homes. Tremors were also felt in Bhutan and the northern Indian state of Bihar. Despite some injuries and property damage, no deaths were reported in Nepal, Bhutan, or India. But the earthquake was an unsettling reminder of how vulnerable these parts of South Asia are to temblors along the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. One of the most destructive of these seismic activities in recent years was the 2015 Nepal earthquake that killed around 9,000 people. Under the Radar On Jan. 7, former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia flew out of Dhaka on an air ambulance sent by the Qatari government. After a brief stopover in Doha, she arrived in London the next day for immediate medical treatment. Zia, the 79-year-old ailing leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), suffers from liver disease and other chronic ailments. Her personal physician said this week that she may need a liver transplant, noting that she might travel to the Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States for additional treatment. The BNP is the main rival of the Awami League the party of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh amid mass protests last August. Zia spent time in detention on corruption charges during the latter part of the Hasina era, and her condition may have worsened after her time in prison. Zia s health also might have raised succession questions. The BNP, like the Awami League, has long been run by a family dynasty. It was founded by Zia s late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who served as president from 1977 until his assassination in 1981. Zia assumed leadership of the party soon afterward. In recent years, her son Tarique Rahman, who is based in London, has taken on a greater role in the party. At the same time, a few senior BNP leaders based in Bangladesh, led by secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, have also exerted more authority. The succession plan might take on more urgency when Bangladesh s interim government, which has no formal BNP representation, announces a timeframe for elections. The BNP has called for polls to take place soon, and they would be favored to win. Regional Voices A Dawn editorial expresses cautious optimism about a new peace accord intended to end years of violence in the northwestern Pakistani region of Kurram, but it warns that it shouldn t be taken for granted: The recently concluded peace deal offers a roadmap to lasting calm, but it can only work if the state has the will to enforce it, and the local tribes agree to abide by all its points. In the Kathmandu Post, journalist Dinesh Kafle laments the loss of Sachin Pariyar, a 15-year-old Nepalese singer who died last week after a long illness: No child should die thinking that their utility in this world is over because their growth is stunted and they cannot earn for others anymore, Kafle writes. Let s mourn young Sachin s passing as the death of our collective conscience as a society. An editorial in the Hindu decries the apparent resurgence of Maoist militants, known as Naxalites, in central India but warns against militarized responses: As tempting as it is to wipe out the Maoist movement through military means ... it is still prudent to use civil society actors to work out a ceasefire agreement and utilize it to end the conflict.

NC_Doc3.docx,"Transition 2025: What Will Trump Do About Iran? Posted by James M. Lindsay January 3, 2025, 5:29 pm (EST) One of the many complex foreign policy problems that Donald Trump will inherit when he takes office in just over two weeks is Iran. It is on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, its robust ballistic missile program continues to progress, and it sees the United States as the main obstacle to its domination of the Middle East. How will Trump respond? That question is easy to answer because Trump has been consistent about his plans: He will return to his first administration s policy of maximum pressure. That effort sought to turn the economic screws on Iran by expanding U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic and ratcheting up the enforcement of sanctions already in place. The goal was not regime change but rather forcing Tehran to limit its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and curb support for the regional militias that made up the so-called axis of resistance. Maximum pressure certainly squeezed the Iranian economy. It failed, however, to force Tehran to the bargaining table. Even as its economy faltered and its foreign reserves dwindled, Iran continued its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, expanded its support for its regional proxies, and even launched a missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq in 2020. Top of Form Bottom of Form Would the maximum pressure campaign have paid off had the Biden administration kept it in place? Trump thinks so. But that is for historians and partisans to debate. The question now is, will maximum pressure work in today s very different geopolitical context? The evidence on that score is mixed. Israel s wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, have weakened Iran s position in the region. Its proxies are fewer and weaker than just six months ago. Beyond that, Israel s October retaliatory air strikes destroyed much of Iran s air defenses, leaving it open to further military attacks. That vulnerability, coupled with Iran s economic woes and domestic unrest, may be why Iran s foreign minister said today that Iran is looking to resume nuclear talks. By the same token, however, a maximum pressure strategy takes time to work. That could be in short supply, at least when it comes to Iran s nuclear program. Iran intensified its uranium-enrichment efforts after Trump terminated the 2015 nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated. By most estimates, Iran can now build a small number of nuclear weapons within weeks of deciding to cross the nuclear threshold. Other great powers will also undermine the maximum pressure policy. China and Russia have both skirted or ignored existing U.S. and multilateral sanctions on Iran. They are unlikely to comply with them now unless they get something significant from the United States in return. Trump may be unwilling or unable to provide that enticement. If Tehran believes that Beijing and Moscow have its back, resistance becomes a more feasible strategy. Tehran could even use negotiations as a way to buy time to address its vulnerabilities. Even if Iran enters into negotiations in good faith, Trump s efforts could stumble over deciding what deal is good enough. The ideological diversity of his team, composed as it is of hardliners and American Firsters, makes it likely they will argue over what Tehran needs to concede to make a deal worthwhile. That internal division could torpedo the effort to get a deal. All of this raises the question of what happens if talks either do not begin or, perhaps more likely, go nowhere once they do. Calls for the United States to attack Iran s nuclear sites are likely to mount if the maximum pressure campaign does not produce quick results. Trump will also likely hear calls that he should encourage Israel to attack Iran, though Israel lacks the capability to destroy Iran s underground nuclear facilities. Tehran will be assessing Trump s willingness to use military force, as well as Israel s military capabilities, as it thinks about negotiations. Iranian leaders know he ordered the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020, spoke on the campaign trail about blowing Iran to smithereens, and has said that Israel should hit Iran s nuclear sites. But they also know that he campaigned against America s forever wars in the Middle East while boasting, wrongly, that he is the only president in seventy-two years that had no wars. And they have to assess whether efforts by Iranian agents to assassinate Trump, something they have denied, might influence his thinking about military options. Resorting to military force, whether with direct U.S. action or by encouraging Israel to attack, would be a major roll of the dice. It might succeed beyond its planners wildest dreams and usher in a new, more peaceful era in the Middle East. Or, like the invasion of Iraq, it may open a Pandora s Box of problems that will haunt the region and the United States for years to come. But, and this is always worth keeping in mind, letting Iran continue its nuclear and ballistic missile programs while it rebuilds its axis of resistance has costs of its own. So here s to hoping that a return to the maximum pressure strategy works, and we discover that the Trump administration has indeed mastered the art of the deal. What Trump Is Saying Trump is famous for his pugnacious and often uncivil attacks on political opponents. So it is worth noting his respectful comments on the passing of former President Jimmy Carter. Trump first posted his gratitude for Carter s service and extended his condolences to the Carter family. An hour later, he added that Carer had worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect. Meanwhile, Trump s supporters waged a mini-civil war over the weekend on whether to end the H-1B visa program. That is the immigration classification that allows employers who say they cannot fill skilled positions with U.S. workers to hire foreign workers instead. Elon Musk led the chorus of those who favor continuing the program; Steve Bannon led the chorus of those opposed. Trump eventually weighed in Musk s side, saying that H-1B visas are a great program and his properties rely on many H-1B visas to operate. It is unlikely, however, that Trump has made much use of H-1B visas, which are for highly skilled workers, during his business career. He may have confused H-1B visas with H-2B visas, which enable unskilled foreign workers to work legally in the United States. In any event, Trump has not always defended the H-1B visa program. In 2016, he vowed to overhaul if not end the program. He tried but failed during his first term. When pressed on the discrepancy in his views, Trump said: I didn t change my mind. Trump commented on a post by tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, who marveled at a chart showing that tariffs have gone from constituting the primary source of federal revenue to a negligible portion. The incoming president declared that Americans were never so wealthy as when tariffs reigned supreme. No, Americans were not wealthier in the 1890s than they are today. They were decidedly poorer. And higher tariffs will not solve America s deficit and debt woes. The United States simply does not import enough goods for tariffs to generate anywhere near enough revenue to close the annual budget deficit, let alone generate a surplus that will pay down the debt. Stemming the flow of red ink in Washington requires cutting spending and raising income taxes. Full stop. What the Biden Administration Is Doing President Joe Biden announced today that he is blocking Nippon Steel s proposed purchase of U.S. Steel. The decision fell to Biden after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government entity charged with reviewing major foreign investments in the United States, deadlocked on a recommendation. Biden justified his decision on the grounds that we need major U.S. companies representing the major share of US steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America s national interests. Trump said last month that he would also block the deal. The issue will now likely head to the courts. Whatever the outcome of that litigation, Biden s decision has strained U.S. relations with Japan, which is understandably piqued that the United States would see an investment by a close ally as a threat to national security. The Biden administration announced on Monday that Chinese government hackers penetrated computer networks at the Treasury Department. The attacks targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which handles U.S. sanctions on countries and individuals, as well as the Office of the Treasury Secretary. The hackers somehow stole a key used by the vendor that maintains Treasury s cloud-based services and then used the key to override the service s security, remotely access certain Treasury DO [departmental offices] user workstations, and access certain unclassified documents maintained by those users. The Biden administration announced on Monday that it is providing another $2.5 billion in military aid and $3.4 billion in civil and economic aid to Ukraine. This new package exhausts most of the funds that Congress appropriated for Ukraine last April. The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Iranian and Russian entities that it claimed attempted to interfere in the 2024 election. The Iranians reportedly used social engineering techniques to access the computers of people in both parties who had direct access to the presidential campaigns. The Russians reportedly used generative AI to create disinformation that it distributed across websites. The U.S. Navy this week conducted additional air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. The periodic airstrikes, which began last March, have yet to succeed in their goal of ending Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. What the Pundits Are Writing Alina Polyakova argued in Foreign Affairs that Trump needs to first increase the pressure on Russia if he hopes to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. She writes: Trump has said that he aims to pursue a deal with Putin, and he is right to want to bring a lasting and sustainable peace to a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and has destabilized geopolitics around the globe. But to achieve that aim, his administration will first need to get the Russians to the table with a willingness to negotiate and make meaningful compromises that will lead to more than a short-term cease-fire. Newsweek s Tom O Connor summarized ten overseas conflicts that Trump will face when he takes office. The Israel-Gaza and Russia-Ukraine conflicts lead O Connor s list. He concludes that given the potential for some of the most volatile of these ongoing conflicts to directly impact U.S. interests at a time when the nation is engaged in a global great power competition with rivals such as China and Russia, the stakes are high in the second Trump administration's efforts to revamp foreign policy in order to Make America Great Again on the world stage. What the Polls Show Gallup asked Americans to predict how 2025 will go. They were more optimistic about the U.S. economy than U.S. foreign policy. While they see rising stock prices and full employment in the year ahead, they also see a year of rising Chinese and Russian power and an increasing number of international disputes.",Neutral,support
NC_Doc4.docx,"Biden s Biggest Foreign Policy Legacy Will Be in Economic Warfare His administration has pushed back harder against rivals and adversaries such as China and Russia, and done so with more potent tools. November 3, 2024 at 7:00 AM CST By Hal Brands Joe Biden s foreign policy will be remembered for many things: the humiliating exit from Afghanistan, the stalwart response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine, the struggle to contain the fallout from Oct. 7 in the Middle East. But Biden has cast his longest shadow by shaping a new era of economic warfare likely to intensify in the years ahead. Economic warfare has figured in great competitions and conflicts since the ancient age. As every reader of Thucydides knows, the Megarian Decree a trade embargo imposed by Athens was a signpost on the road to the Peloponnesian War. In 1941, a US oil embargo against Japan helped to trigger the attack on Pearl Harbor and globalize World War II. During the Cold War, the free world contained the Soviet Union in economic as well as military terms. After the Cold War, the US mostly used sanctions against rogue states and terrorist groups, while hoping that economic integration could lead to great-power peace. But amid escalating geopolitical rivalries, first Donald Trump and now, more systematically, Joe Biden, have increasingly wielded economic weapons. After Vladimir Putin s invasion of Ukraine, the US and its allies blitzed Russia with a stunning array of sanctions. Biden s China strategy has featured domestic investments to keep the US ahead in key sectors of the 21st century economy and targeted restrictions, from investment curbs to export controls, to keep Beijing from catching up. These measures are reshaping the global economy. They can serve to avert devastating military conflicts or to prepare for them. And this contest is hardly a one-way affair: Autocratic powers, namely China, are racing to blunt the impact of Western sanctions even as they sharpen their own economic knives for the long struggles ahead. So, navigating this new era will require learning 10 lessons from the Biden years. First, economic warfare is back for a very old reason: Economic strength is the wellspring of global power. A country s military prowess reflects its economy s heft and dynamism. Even in peacetime, economic influence helps to win friends and punish enemies. As strategic competition sharpens, economic rivalry becomes a cut-throat business. For a generation after 1989, America had no real competitors. Even as the US sanctioned tin-pot dictators and lethal terrorists, it sought to draw potential great-power rivals into the global economy in hopes of making them satisfied members of an American-led world. It didn t work out as planned. Russia used access to the international economy, as well as the post-2001 oil boom, to rebuild its military. It cultivated European dependence on Russian energy, in hopes of neutralizing resistance to its own broader ambitions. China s access to foreign markets enabled a decades-long, export-driven boom and a record-shattering, increasingly disruptive military buildup. Beijing also made a mercantilist push to dominate industries both old (e.g., steel) and new (e.g., advanced telecommunications). China and Russia were using economic statecraft to weaken the very system that had assisted their rise. Now, the US is pushing back harder, and with more potent tools. This relates to a second lesson, which is that the toolkit has expanded, and its tools have become sharper. My Johns Hopkins colleague Adam Szubin makes this point and he would know, having been a top Treasury official in the Obama years. Traditionally, economic warfare featured blockades and trade embargoes. These measures were potentially powerful, but also difficult and costly to impose. If Britain wanted to crush Napoleonic France, for instance, it had to physically blockade Europe and even then, the results were disappointing. Over the past quarter-century, however, the US has honed a sharper, more targeted set of sanctions that exploit its control of chokepoints in the global economy. They inflict outsized damage on an adversary by barring it from key sources of innovation and prosperity in the modern world. Biden s team didn t invent these tools, many of which emerged in earlier fights against Iran, North Korea and al Qaeda. But it did refine them and apply them more extensively especially against great-power rivals than any prior administration. History will record that the US-China tech war began in earnest in October 2022. That s when Biden rolled out far-reaching export controls that used the primacy of the dollar in global finance, as well as America s role in a specific supply chain (designing high-end semiconductors), to curtail China s access to the advanced chips that power economic and military innovation. Under Trump, Washington had used those tools to target a single company, Huawei. Biden expanded the restrictions to target China as a whole. This strategy built on what the US had done earlier to Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, exploiting the centrality of the dollar, and America s influence in key financial messaging systems, to disconnect Russian banks from the world. Washington cut off Russia s access to the most sophisticated semiconductors a preview of what would soon happen to China. The US and its allies also used their financial dominance to freeze Russia s huge foreign reserve holdings and their preeminence in maritime insurance markets and other crucial services to cap the price of oil that Russia exports to the globe. No one could have predicted the severity of those sanctions, Russia s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. In the world s two most important rivalries, Biden has aggressively and creatively wielded America s asymmetric economic advantages. He has also subtly shifted the purpose of those sanctions. Indeed, a third lesson is that attrition is displacing coercion. The point of modern economic warfare is more often to weaken an opponent s capabilities than to change his mind. That hasn t always been the case. For decades, the US viewed sanctions primarily as tools to modify weaker adversaries behavior to persuade Iran, for instance, to negotiate a nuclear deal. Even the tariffs Trump slapped on China were intended to change Beijing s approach to development and trade. Yet Biden s strategy has often had a different aim. Almost no one expected the sanctions imposed on Russia in February 2022 and after whether tech restrictions or Germany s cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline to compel Putin s withdrawal from Ukraine. The goal was merely to weaken a dangerous rival in a protracted struggle to impair their ability to compete, as Biden explained. Similarly, Biden didn t make any specific asks of Beijing when he imposed semiconductor curbs or restricted US investment in China s high-tech sector. That s because these sanctions are strategic, not transactional: Their primary purpose is to hinder China s innovation in areas essential to economic and military power. Coercive sanctions persist: Biden threatened China with harsh penalties if it exported weapons to Russia in 2022-23. But since America probably can t fundamentally change the behavior of its rivals, keeping them behind will have to be good enough. Doing so requires heeding a fourth lesson: Building up one s own capabilities is as important as holding down those of the other side. The counterpart to Biden s chip curbs on China was his administration s investment in expanded domestic chip production. Biden s tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and his subsidies to bolster America s EV industry, are two sides of the same coin. Granted, industrial policy s track record is uneven and as the international reaction to the Inflation Reduction Act shows, protectionism can annoy America s friends. But the measures America has used to prevent rivals from ruling key supply chains will only buy time unless they are paired with a more positive agenda in the US and the larger democratic world. Thus, a fifth lesson: Even a superpower needs lots of help. America has an unmatched ability to squeeze its competitors. But effective economic warfare work still entails bringing allies along. Freezing Russia s foreign reserves required the cooperation of the European countries in which Putin had stashed so much of his loot. Enforcing semiconductor controls requires working with countries Taiwan, Japan, the Netherlands, and others that make advanced chips and the equipment used to manufacture them. Starving China s high-tech industries of foreign capital will be much easier if allies in Europe and Asia join the fight. America s financial power and alliance networks give it leverage: It s hard for Taiwan or Japan to tell their primary security partner to take a hike. But the process isn t always pretty. The run-up to the Ukraine war saw protracted transatlantic wrangling over how harshly to penalize a Russian invasion. Securing Japanese and Dutch collaboration on semiconductor curbs was (and remains) a fraught endeavor. The Biden team has tried to win cooperation through engagement and persuasion with the implicit threat that it might just use the same sanctions to compel allies if they don t play ball. No matter how targeted, sanctions inflict pain on the countries that impose them; not every democracy sees the world as America might like. Economic warfare is waged against one s enemies; it also requires some rough bargaining with one s friends. Sixth, economic warfare can be a substitute for military warfare or a means of waging it. The appeal of sanctions is that they allow Washington to jostle for advantage without getting into a physical fight. That s especially important given that conflict with China or Russia could lead, as Biden has said, to World War III. But the line between military and economic issues isn t always bright and clear. One reason the US is so concerned about China s access to high-end semiconductors is that those chips could end up in Beijing s nuclear arsenal or other military capabilities. And one reason Washington triggered those curbs in October 2022 was that a high-profile crisis over Taiwan two months earlier had raised concerns that America and China might be headed for a shooting war. If Washington and Beijing do end up in a more dangerous Taiwan crisis, the US might threaten to employ stronger trade, tech and financial sanctions to deter a Chinese attack or ratchet up the price it incurs. Economic statecraft isn t just some enlightened alternative to military conflict; it is a way of shaping the battlefield in intense, bloody fights. Seventh, economic warfare is powerful, but it s not a wonder weapon. Just look at what sanctions have and haven t achieved against Russia. Sanctions have strained Russia s finances, restricted its access to Western technology and caused deep economic imbalances. But contrary to some premature crowing by Biden, sanctions haven t brought that economy crashing down. Russia continues to find large sums for defense; its war industries are churning out tanks and shells. Its ability to do both tells us a lot about the limits of modern economic warfare. A Russia isolated by the West pivoted toward trade with the East, especially China. Moscow rapidly learned the art of sanctions evasion just witness how much Western tech still ends up in Russian arms with assists from Beijing and Tehran. It skirted the oil price cap by building a shadow fleet of tankers that carries illicit crude. Not least, Russia benefitted from Western skittishness. The US and its allies tried to limit the price Putin gets for his oil. But they haven t really tried to remove it from the global market, by aggressively sanctioning its buyers, for fear of roiling relations with swing states such as India and causing widespread economic disruptions. The implications for a Taiwan crisis are worth pondering. Perhaps, as some US analysts hope, a sanctions blitz will bring China to its knees. Or perhaps greater interdependence between the US and China will simply make it too hard to blast Beijing without causing ghastly collateral damage. And surely a key lesson of the Ukraine war is that strangling a major power isn t easy especially if that country is preparing for the assault. An eighth lesson is that America s tactics are inspiring insulation and imitation. US adversaries, principally China, are trying to protect themselves from economic pressure while developing economic arsenals of their own. Beijing is hoarding fuel, food and other commodities that could be cut off in a crisis. It is building a payment system to get around the Western-dominated SWIFT and striving for technological self-reliance to blunt US export controls. Meanwhile, the autocratic quartet China, Russia, Iran and North Korea is developing geographically protected trade routes to foster a Eurasian economic bloc that is beyond America s wrath. China isn t just playing defense. In recent years, Beijing has restricted trade and tourism with South Korea, Australia, Lithuania and other disobedient democracies. It has announced (largely symbolic) restrictions on the export of key minerals. Now, China is assembling a larger arsenal of export controls, asset freezes, financial restrictions, and many of the same measures Washington uses, so it can deter the use of foreign sanctions or take the offensive against its enemies. China s toolkit still doesn t rival America s: That s a key reason Beijing has refrained from responding too strongly to Biden s tech squeeze. But China is preparing for the future because it doesn t want economic warfare to be a one-way street. Of course, bad actors aren t the only ones that worry about the reach of US sanctions. Friendlier countries also fear that the US might turn the same tools against them someday. A ninth lesson, then, is that the danger of overuse is real, even if the damage is still mostly hypothetical. India, for instance, may be the biggest winner from Western sanctions against Russia, which have allowed it to buy oceans of Putin s oil at bargain prices. But it simultaneously wants to ensure, as Fareed Zakaria has reported, that America could never do to India what it has just done to Russia. It s a common sentiment. As US sanctions have skyrocketed, more countries are looking to limit their vulnerability. A BRICS summit last month buzzed with talk of de-dollarization. During the Trump years, even close allies in Europe experimented with alternative financial mechanisms meant to evade US influence. The barriers to diversification are high because the dollar remains ubiquitous in global finance. De-dollarization is still more of a catch-phrase than a reality. But the more aggressively the US uses sanctions, the more it risks undermining the advantages, and alienating the allies, that make them so potent in the first place. That s worth remembering, in view of a final lesson: The new age of economic warfare is only beginning. The US and China are playing a cat-and-mouse game in which Beijing tries to evade one set of sanctions, causing the US to adapt and tighten them. And while Washington has moved against Beijing on the most advanced chips, another battle to ensure China doesn t dominate production of widely used legacy chips now looms. Moreover, a whole suite of new technologies chips, quantum computing, AI, advanced robotics, synthetic biology will shape the global economy. The campaigns for supremacy in these areas are now unfolding. For all the Biden team s declarations that it is pursuing a small yard, high fence strategy to safeguard US technological advantages, the yard just keeps getting bigger. The next president, in fact, will surely reach for the same weapons Biden has wielded. If Donald Trump is elected, America will have an economically pugilistic president who if his first term is any guide will pressure allies as well as enemies in the quest for US advantage. If Kamala Harris prevails, she may persist with the more targeted, multilateral approach she inherited from Biden. Even so, she will likely expand the use of these economic tools, as US-Russia tensions remain high and deteriorating US-China relations turn points of interaction into vectors for vulnerability. Today, economic statecraft is at the very core of the struggle for global power and influence. That won t change, no matter how the coming election turns out.",Support,support
PA_Doc1_Economy-solid-2025.docx,"Economy poised for a solid year in 2025. But these Trump plans could slow growth. The U.S. economy and job market are expected to cool in 2025 but still turn in another year of solid growth as inflation eases further, forecasters say. But as a result of President-elect Donald Trump s dueling policy agendas, the outlook is leavened with an unusual dose of uncertainty. Trump s plans to impose massive tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status are likely to reignite inflation and dampen economic growth, according to forecasters. Yet his pledge to extend and expand the sweeping tax cuts passed in his first term and ease the regulatory burden on businesses could juice the economy and have mixed effects on inflation. So, which of the incoming administration s contrasting policy agendas is likely to move the needle for the economy this year? ""The only certainty is uncertainty,"" said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist of Oxford Economics. ""If the focus is more on deregulation, tax cuts and potential sweeteners than changes to tariffs and immigration, then growth could be much stronger in 2025,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist of KMPG U.S., wrote in a report. ""Otherwise, risks are for higher inflation and weaker expansion."" How will the economy do in 2025? Generally, forecasters see 2025 as a transition year as the economy continues its post-pandemic recovery but at a lower temperature before Trump s policies fully take effect. For workers, healthy wage growth is likely to keep outpacing slowing inflation, fueling consumer spending and job gains. The Federal Reserve s interest rate cuts, which began in 2024 and are set to continue this year assuming inflation eases further, should provide a boost to growth. Meanwhile, Trump is likely to rein in the scope of the tariffs and deportations he promised on the campaign trail, some economists say. And the programs likely will take months to ramp up, delaying their toll on the economy and inflation until the second half of the year. Instead of the recession Moody s Analytics forecast a few months ago, the research firm now foresees a more slowly growing economy in 2025. ""The economy is in a good place and consumers will again do their part to drive the economic train,"" Moody s Chief Economist Mark Zandi said. But, he added: ""It won t grow as much as it should because of economic policy."" Will tariffs increase? During the campaign, Trump vowed to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese imports and 10% levies on shipments from all other countries to prod manufacturers to move production back to the U.S. Recently, he threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% fees on China to pressure the countries to curtail the flow of illegal drugs and unauthorized immigration to the U.S. Ultimately, Zandi figures Trump will hit China with 20% tariffs while Sweet is looking for 30% duties. The economists also expect smaller levies on Canada, Mexico, and parts of Europe as well as Asian nations such as Vietnam and Japan that could serve as alternative production sources to China. Trump is sensitive to the performance of the economy and stock market and is likely to soften the tariffs if they hammer those closely-watched gauges, Zandi and Sweet said.",Support,oppose
PA_Doc2_Trump-Critics-reconciling.docx,"Trump's return to power has old critics and skeptics reconciling with a new 'normal' Across the spectrum of American society, leaders who once shunned Trump or battled him are now seeking to bolster their ties or extend olive branches. Jan. 11, 2025, 5:00 AM EST In the weeks and months after Donald Trump won his shock election victory in 2016, business and tech leaders began a steady march leftward, adopting policies and postures to counter his influence on America. Media outlets reckoned with what some saw as their leading role in helping Trump get elected and pledged to be ruthless and unintimidated in their coverage of him and his administration. And Democrats, boosted by a grassroots resistance, readied for their biggest fight yet. That couldn t be any more different from the run-up to Trump s second term. Now, executives are bending policies and bending a proverbial knee by abandoning their social and environmental agendas in manners that could appeal to Trump. Leaders of multiple major media platforms appear to be reorienting their coverage to be less antagonistic. And Democrats, without much of an active resistance to underpin them, have taken a wait-and-see approach to a new president with whom they already have eight years of experience. We should treat him like a normal president, a senior aide to a Democratic senator said. Because this is what normal presidents look like in America now. The shift is due in no small part to how Trump won last fall. Whereas in 2016 many saw a fluke, Trump this time swept the swing states and won the popular vote. His victory came after episodes like the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and his criminal indictments headwinds many believed were insurmountable. What s more, much of his opposition, at least for now, appears to be drained after having fought him for nearly a decade. Now, Democrats feel they must pick their spots better.

I certainly see Greenland as an opportunity, a great national security addition, said Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican of Kansas. The Panama Canal, I certainly understand President Trump s concerns that China has a huge presence there now. And that s being abused. That s a national security issue. We ll see what happens. Sen.

PA_Doc4_Student-Loans-Trump.docx,"What You Need to Know About Student Loans Before Trump Takes Office Jan. 20 As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office January 20, many Americans across the country are wondering what this will mean for their student loans. President Joe Biden ushered in student loan forgiveness for millions during his presidency, but a new Trump presidency has many borrowers concerned about how their debt could change in 2025. Trump's own for-profit college, Trump University, was hit with a lawsuit alleging fraud. It ended with a $25 million settlement to those who attended the now defunct school. How Will Student Loans Change When Trump Takes Office? Based on Trump's track record, student loan borrowers are unlikely to see any more relief under the new administration. During his first term, his administration pushed for monthly payments to increase from 10 to 12.5 percent of borrowers' discretionary income and also sought to merge all income-driven repayment plans into one simplified option. In his second term, these moves could come up again. Will Biden's SAVE Plan Stay in Place? During Biden's presidency, he introduced a Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan that cut down payments for millions and even led to student loan forgiveness for some. The income-based plan reduced many borrowers' monthly payments to zero, saved other borrowers around $1,000 per year and prevented balances from growing because of unpaid interest. ""President Trump signaled opposition to these programs on the campaign trail, so the likelihood of them suddenly gaining support seems virtually nonexistent. If you haven't been treating your student debt seriously in the hope of future forgiveness, now is the time to start tackling it by making payments,"" Beene said. What Happens Next Thompson said borrowers should prepare for the likelihood that all student loan debt will be expected to be repaid under Trump's administration. ""Unless the Biden administration pushes through last-minute executive action for additional loan forgiveness, the likelihood of widespread relief under Trump is low,"" he said. ""His previous term rolled back consumer protections and shifted student loan policies toward a more rigid framework. The expectation will likely be that borrowers repay their loans in full, reinforcing the principle of caveat emptor buyer beware."" Borrowers should look into refinancing and consolidation options. ""Interest rates, repayment structures and federal protections could change under a new administration, and borrowers will need to be proactive in managing their financial future,"" Thompson said. ""If you're holding out for student loan forgiveness, it may be time to rethink your strategy. Under Trump, the focus will likely be on repayment enforcement rather than relief.""",Oppose,oppose
TK_Doc1_Student-Loan-Cancellation.docx,"Nearly four million borrowers have had about $138 billion of their federal student loans flagged for cancellation, despite a Supreme Court ruling last June that blocked relief for millions more student-loan holders. The high court ruled that the Biden administration couldn t cancel hundreds of billions of dollars for tens millions of student-loan holders, reasoning that the authority for such a broad-based policy doesn t exist under the law. While that closed one path, Biden tapped a variety of different tools that no previous president had ever used to this extent. The administration announced its latest round of cancellations on Feb. 21, forgiving about $1.2 billion in loans for roughly 153,000 borrowers. Since taking office in 2021, the Biden administration has arranged to cancel loans equal to around a third of the total projected cost of its blocked mass cancellation plan. Here s how: Around 40 million people owe nearly $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt. Biden sought to cancel $430 billion of it through a blanket forgiveness plan announced in August 2022. The Supreme Court blocked that strategy in June. Using existing tools, the administration has cobbled together batches of forgiven loans that now total around $137.8 billion. The amount equals about a third of the total cost of the mass cancellation plan. Using anti-fraud and consumer protection regulations, the administration has forgiven $22.5 billion for more than 1.3 million borrowers who say they were cheated by their schools, saw their institutions close suddenly or are covered by related court settlements. Many of these borrower defense claims had languished for years. The administration whittled down the backlog through approvals and settlements. A revamped application process has led to $11.7 billion forgiven for 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability. Waivers and tweaked rules for public-service loan forgiveness, a program dating to 2007, have led to almost $56.7 billion in forgiveness for 793,400 public servants since 2021. The Biden administration has said income-driven repayment programs have been troubled by inaccuracies for decades. Addressing those issues allowed it to forgive nearly $45.7 billion for almost 930,500 borrowers. The 153,000 borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan received $1.2 billion in forgiveness ahead of schedule. Borrowers owed less than $12,000 and had been making payments for ten years. Not all of the $138 billion in relief has been fully processed by the Education Department and loan servicers, creating confusion for borrowers who must now figure out whether they still have outstanding student loan debt. That issue has become more pressing since payments and interest accrual restarted in 2023 after a pandemic-era freeze that lasted more than three years. While the tools the administration is using in its piecemeal cancellation strategy have a long history of passing legal muster, they still run some risk of getting tied up in court. In August, a federal court in New Orleans froze the administration s expansion of borrower defense the tool for students who think they have been misled by their schools leaving its future prospects unclear.",Support,oppose
TK_Doc2_Biden-39B-Forgiveness.docx,"More than 800,000 older borrowers will see their federal student debt disappear. Student loan borrowers on income-driven repayment plans who have made 20 or 25 years of payments will get their remaining balances wiped out in coming weeks, the Education Department said. Eligible borrowers will be notified starting Friday. A total of $39 billion will be forgiven as part of a one-time adjustment to loan repayment plans the Biden administration announced last year. Separate from the higher-profile $430 billion program the Supreme Court struck down in late June, this one-time adjustment will give borrowers credit retroactively for months that previously hadn t been counted. Income-driven plans for federal student debt tie monthly payments to a borrower s family size and income and forgive any remaining balances after 20 or 25 years of payments. The Education Department said that inaccurate payment counts in the past resulted in borrowers losing progress toward loan forgiveness. For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said of the adjustment Friday. In this one-time adjustment, some borrowers will move closer to forgiveness and others will see their loans discharged. Some might receive a refund for previous payments, should the adjustment result in a borrower having exceeded the number of months required. Income-driven repayment plans were designed to help low-earning borrowers repay their student loans, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous paperwork, officials said. Borrowers whose loans were in forbearance or deferred due to economic hardships for a time will have those months credited toward their repayment histories. This applies to those with Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loans and who are currently participating in income-driven repayment plans or were previously enrolled in one. The Education Department previously made a similar adjustment to those in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Once these payments are accounted for, borrowers will see their loan balances automatically discharged or reduced in the coming weeks. The adjustment will mainly benefit those who have struggled to make progress on eliminating their debt despite nearly two decades of payments. This is not a fix to anything going forward, said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a nonprofit trade association for student loan servicers. This is a one-time fix where they re counting statuses that were not permitted to be counted in the past. Those currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans or the public-service plan will be able to get credit for partial or late payments. Those who enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan called Saving on Valuable Education, or SAVE, will be able to make much smaller payments and still see that payment count toward forgiveness. Borrowers making under $32,800 a year, or $67,500 for a family, won t owe loan payments. In such cases, those months will still count toward their path to forgiveness. For the millions of borrowers not on income-driven repayment plans and still hoping for forgiveness, the Education Department said the secretary is considering other ways to provide debt relief. After the Supreme Court struck down the previous plan proposed by the Biden administration, President Biden said he would try using a different authority, the Higher Education Act of 1965, to launch a new program.",Neutral,support
TK_Doc3_Biden-Loan-Halted.docx,"WASHINGTON A federal appeals court Friday temporarily stopped the Biden administration from moving forward with its plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student-loan debt for millions of Americans. The Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the halt in a one-page order that will remain in place for a short period while it considers a request by Republican leaders in six states to block implementation of the program. The Biden administration has said in court filings that it wouldn t discharge any student-loan debt before Oct. 23. The appeals court order at least pushes back that start date a few days, though White House officials have said it could take weeks to process the bulk of the applications. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that the order doesn t prevent borrowers from applying for the program or the administration from reviewing applications. We will continue to move full speed ahead in our preparations in compliance with this order, Ms. Jean-Pierre said. And the administration will continue to fight Republican officials suing to block our efforts to provide relief to working families, she added. It s very important that the legal issues involving presidential power be analyzed by the court before transferring over $400 billion in debt to American taxpayers, said Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, who is part of the appeal. The Biden administration estimates the debt relief would cost $379 billion over 30 years, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a similar estimate of around $400 billion that assumed 90% of eligible borrowers would apply. Friday s decision by the appeals court comes one day after a federal judge in Missouri denied a request by the group of Republican state leaders to block the program. The appeals court, which is hearing an appeal of the Missouri judge s order, set a briefing schedule with deadlines early next week. The development comes just hours after President Biden touted his efforts to forgive student loans during a speech at a Delaware university on Friday. Mr. Biden praised the Thursday ruling and pointed to a separate move by the Supreme Court to deny an emergency appeal to block implementation of the program brought by a group of Wisconsin taxpayers. The courts, the president argued earlier Friday, had sent a message: We re on Biden s side. The administration on Monday began accepting applications for loan forgiveness through an online portal that requires applicants to provide only basic information such as their legal names, Social Security numbers and email addresses. Officials have said it would take several weeks to process the applications. Some applicants will be asked for additional information to verify their incomes. So far, nearly 22 million borrowers have applied for forgiveness through the program, Mr. Biden said. The site hasn t experienced any major technical issues, according to administration officials and analysts tracking the issue. The Education Department has begun informing some borrowers that they don t need to apply for the program because the department already has enough information about their loans to process their forgiveness. In emails to borrowers who don t need to apply, the department said they have the right to opt out of the program if, for example, they are concerned about having to pay state taxes on the debt that is forgiven. Those borrowers have until Nov. 14 to alert their loan servicers that they are opting out of the program, according to the department emails. The administration has estimated that roughly eight million people fall into this category.",Neutral,oppose
TK_Doc4_Biden-Loan-Hurdles.docx,"The Biden administration faces a complicated legal path for jump-starting its mass student-debt cancellation plan after a federal judge in Texas blocked it on Thursday. In light of the ruling, the Education Department has stopped accepting applications for the program after nearly 20 million people submitted their income information in recent weeks. The administration immediately moved to appeal the decision and could file a motion that seeks to stay the Texas ruling for now. But even if that request were successful, the White House is still facing a roadblock in a separate case pending in a different jurisdiction. The St. Louis-based Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals already had placed the program on hold in a temporary order last month, in a case brought by Republican officials in six states. An additional ruling from that court is expected in the coming days. On Wednesday, before the debt-relief plan was struck down, President Biden singled out the issue as a top one that motivated young voters to turn out for the midterms in historic numbers. We will continue to keep borrowers informed about our efforts to deliver targeted relief, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Friday. Separately, we remain committed to taking other actions to fix longstanding issues in the student loan forgiveness system and hold schools accountable for leaving students with mountains of debt and without the skills and preparation to find good jobs. Biden administration officials have been quietly preparing for the possibility that a court would strike down the program, according to administration officials, and have been discussing both legal and policy responses to such a move. In particular, it remains unknown whether the administration will seek to extend the pandemic-era pause on student-debt payments. Interest has been frozen and payments have been suspended since March 2020, but the administration was planning to end the pause as of Jan. 1. An online petition from the Student Debt Crisis Center, a borrower-support organization, had accrued more than 20,000 signatures as of late Friday morning, asking Mr. Biden to extend the pause until all roadblocks to receiving debt relief have been removed. The Biden debt-cancellation plan would forgive up to $10,000 for federal student-loan borrowers who make under $125,000 a year, or $250,000 for married couples. Pell Grant recipients would qualify for an additional $10,000 in relief. Thursday s ruling from U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman called the Biden administration s plan an unconstitutional exercise of Congress s legislative power and said that borrowers hadn t been able to weigh in on the merits of the program through a rule-making process. The lawsuit was supported by the Job Creators Network Foundation, a conservative group founded by Home Depot Inc. co-founder Bernie Marcus. The Education Department said it was ready to immediately move to forgive debt for 16 million borrowers whose applications for relief have already been processed, when allowed by the courts. Some debt relief proponents faulted the administration for not moving to automatically cancel debt, rather than giving opponents of the program time to formulate legal challenges. Legal scholars are split on whether borrowers could see their debt balances restored if they were forgiven as part of a program that is ultimately ruled unconstitutional.",Neutral,oppose
