GDR_Doc4_Ai_Policy_Directions.txt," Title: AI Policy Directions in the New Trump Administration Authors: John Villasenor Source/Date: Brookings Institution, November 2024 URL: Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Policy, Trump Administration, Regulation, Innovation Summary: The Trump administration s approach to artificial intelligence (AI) policy reflects a commitment to fostering innovation while addressing the regulatory and ethical challenges posed by this transformative technology. The administration s policy directions prioritize reducing regulatory barriers to accelerate AI research and development, encouraging public-private collaboration, and promoting workforce development to meet the demands of an AI-driven economy. A central focus of the administration s AI strategy is the establishment of guidelines for ethical AI use. These guidelines aim to balance the need for innovation with the imperative to prevent harm caused by biased algorithms or misuse of AI technologies. While some critics argue that the administration s approach lacks sufficient safeguards, proponents believe it provides the flexibility needed to maintain the U.S. s competitive edge. Public-private partnerships are a cornerstone of the administration s AI policy. By facilitating collaboration between federal agencies, industry leaders, and academic institutions, the administration seeks to create an ecosystem conducive to innovation. These partnerships are expected to drive advancements in areas such as healthcare, defense, and infrastructure, where AI applications can deliver substantial benefits. The administration also emphasizes the importance of workforce development to prepare Americans for the jobs of the future. Investments in STEM education and AI-specific training programs aim to equip workers with the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly AI-driven world. These efforts include expanding access to education in underserved communities to ensure a diverse and inclusive AI workforce. On the international stage, the Trump administration advocates for collaboration with allies to set global standards for AI governance. By engaging in multilateral efforts, the U.S. seeks to promote democratic values and counter authoritarian approaches to AI development and use. This strategy underscores the administration s recognition of AI as not only a technological issue but also a geopolitical one. While the administration s AI policy has sparked debate, it underscores a forward-looking approach aimed at harnessing the transformative potential of AI. By reducing regulatory hurdles, encouraging collaboration, and prioritizing workforce development, the administration aims to position the United States as a leader in the global AI landscape.",support,0,1,oppose
SKSK_Doc3_ Biden-Harris-Improving-Access.txt," FACT SHEET: Biden- Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable Care Act President Biden announces nearly 24 million consumers have signed up for Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage, nearly doubling enrollment during the last 4 years President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. Since day one of their Administration, they have taken steps to ensure that every American has access to affordable, quality health care. And, as a result of these efforts, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that it has set another all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment, with nearly 24 million Americans signing up for coverage with one week left in the 2025 Open Enrollment Period. A total of 45 million Americans have coverage through the ACA either the Marketplace or Medicaid expansion and more people have health insurance today than ever in our nation s history. Statement from the President: Today, we have once again set a record when it comes to ensuring access to affordable, quality health care: nearly 24 million Americans have signed up for Affordable Care Act coverage. That means that enrollment has nearly doubled since I took office. That s no coincidence. When I took office, I made a promise to the American people that I would bring down the cost of health care and prescription drugs, make signing up for coverage easier, and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. I m proud that my Administration delivered even as Republican elected officials, who have been eager to put millions of Americans coverage at risk, stood in the way. I urge Congress to double down on the progress we have made and ensure Americans have access to quality, affordable health care by extending the ACA premium tax credit this year. Today s announcement builds upon a remarkable record of success over the last four years. More Americans have health insurance than ever before, with 1/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C... the uninsured rate at record lows. In fact, in every year of the Biden-Harris Administration, we have set a new all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment. This record-breaking enrollment is no accident, and due to this Administration s efforts to lower health care costs and make it easier to sign up for coverage. We also made health care more affordable for Americans purchasing their health insurance on the ACA Marketplace, saving consumers an average of $800 annually on their premiums. For example, this Administration made the largest ever investment in outreach and enrollment assistance, especially those in rural or underserved communities while at the same time eliminating bureaucratic red tape that makes it harder for people to enroll in coverage. But all of these efforts to lower health care costs and expand coverage are now in danger. If Republicans in Congress take away the enhanced premium tax credits that make ACA coverage more affordable, premiums will skyrocket and people will lose coverage. For many families the results will be catastrophic: A single parent earing $50,00 per year could see their premiums increase by $1600 per year. 2/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C... A retired couple earning $85,000 per year could see their premiums increase by $18,000 per year. Experts estimate that 3 to 5 million people would become uninsured. The Affordable Care Act Marketplaces are just one part of this Administration s commitment to health care coverage. Today, Medicaid covers about 80 million people. Thanks to the President s leadership, over one million Americans in four states now have Medicaid expansion coverage, driving total ACA-related enrollment to over 45 million. This Administration has also cut red tape to make applying for and renewing Medicaid coverage easier, and established new standards to ensure people have access to the care they need when they need it. In addition to today s record-breaking enrollment numbers, we are also releasing a report and a data chart pack detailing the Biden-Harris Administration s historic progress to improve the health of millions of Americans from making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, to tackling crises in mental health, maternal health, and more, and investing in public health infrastructure. Some highlights include: In its first year alone, President Biden s Medicare Drug Price Negotiation program outperformed expectations, achieving negotiated prices that are 38 to 79 percent lower than U.S. list prices for the ten first round negotiated drugs. These prices are $6 billion per year lower than what Medicare pays today and, once in effect, will put $1.5 billion dollars back into the pockets of Medicare beneficiaries. Seniors with Medicare are protected by the new $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs, and insulin is capped at just $35 per month. The Administration ended the family glitch, making millions of family members finally eligible for affordable ACA Marketplace coverage with about one million people projected to either gain coverage or have lower premiums. The 988 lifeline, created under this Administration, has answered more than 11 million calls, chats, and texts and made it easier for individuals experiencing distress to access immediate care. Following the Administration s efforts to reduce overdose deaths, recent data shows a 17% reduction in overdose deaths in the 12 months ending July 2024 compared to the prior year the largest decline in U.S. history. 3/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C... After the release of a comprehensive strategy to improve maternal health, 46 states and DC extended Medicaid postpartum coverage from two to twelve months for hundreds of thousands of new mothers.

NC_Doc2.docx,"The Biden Administration Pursues Last-Minute Diplomacy With India In New Delhi, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan seeks to foolproof some elements of the partnership. By Michael Kugelman, the writer of Foreign Policy s weekly South Asia Brief and the director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. Jake Sullivan Visits New Delhi U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other top officials in New Delhi on Jan. 6. Sullivan s visit came on the heels of Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar s trip to the United States last December, which featured meetings with senior officials and lawmakers. This flurry of high-level diplomacy at the tail end of U.S. President Joe Biden s term highlights the depth of the U.S.-India partnership as well as some shakiness as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time. By visiting India just two weeks before the end of the Biden era, Sullivan sent a strong message. In a speech at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Sullivan said that this overseas trip marked his last as national security advisor. I cannot think of a better way to end my tenure in the White House visiting India ... to mark the advances we have made together, he said, mentioning achievements in defense and technology cooperation. Sullivan also announced that obstacles preventing the full implementation of a 2008 civil nuclear agreement long envisioned as a cornerstone of U.S.-India cooperation will soon be removed. There is strong bipartisan support in Washington for partnership with India, especially because of its envisioned role helping the United States counter China. Trump will undoubtedly support this position. Still, Sullivan s trip also hinted at possible concerns about momentum in the relationship amid the U.S. leadership transition. The visit can be read in part as an effort to foolproof what both sides regard as a signature achievement of bilateral cooperation during the Biden era: the U.S.-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), which was a major focus of Sullivan s meetings in New Delhi. The initiative has inspired collaborations on defense, space, and artificial intelligence. Significantly, iCET is led by both countries national security advisors, which reduces the risk of it getting bogged down by bureaucracy. But this advantage could become a vulnerability with a leadership change. Trump will support technology collaborations with India, especially if they relate to countering China. But he has previously taken a hard line on export controls and threatened to impose tariffs on India both of which could constrain tech cooperation. Sullivan s discussions in India likely touched on how to ensure that iCET can withstand any resistance from the next administration. Likewise, Jaishankar probably used his meeting with Rep. Mike Waltz, Trump s pick for national security advisor, to reinforce the importance of iCET. The initiative may not be the only Biden-era achievement that Washington and New Delhi are looking to safeguard: Sullivan said that he was in touch with Trump s team about the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, a connectivity initiative that was announced in 2023. Finally, both Sullivan and Jaishankar s visits probably focused on one of the biggest tension points between the United States and India: the U.S. Justice Department case against an Indian national accused of a failed assassination plot against a Sikh activist and U.S. citizen in New York on behalf of New Delhi. The White House has sought India s cooperation in the U.S. investigation through India s own inquiry committee; Sullivan has reportedly been a lead interlocutor. The issue likely figured into many of his engagements in New Delhi and his meeting with Jaishankar in Washington. The U.S.-India relationship will have a relatively easy transition to Trump s second term, thanks to the many areas of cooperation publicly celebrated during the Jaishankar and Sullivan visits. But that heady rhetoric hides the hard work that remains. Eleventh-hour diplomacy is likely intended to help ease the burden. What We re Following Opposition negotiations underway in Pakistan. Pakistani officials have begun talks with leaders from jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after months of tensions and government crackdowns on the party and its supporters. Khan has been in jail since August 2023 on charges that his supporters denounce as politically motivated. The decision to hold talks is encouraging: There has been little dialogue between the two sides since Khan was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in 2022. Violent protests targeting military facilities after his arrest in 2023, an election last year criticized for irregularities, a crackdown against PTI protesters in November, and military court convictions of political protesters in December have further inflamed the political environment. Khan likely agreed to talks because the PTI is in a tough spot. The November protests in Islamabad achieved little, and divides are growing among the party leaders who are not in jail. But the discussions have made little progress so far. The PTI s main demands are that its supporters be released from jail and for independent investigations into the 2023 protests targeting military facilities (which the PTI says that it was not involved with) and the November crackdown in Islamabad. The party has also called for unfettered access to Khan to discuss its negotiating strategy. Of course, its most important demand is the release of Khan. Pakistan s military leadership may be open in principle to a deal that would free him. But it would likely condition such a move on Khan going into exile or pledging to stay quiet neither of which he would agree to. Ideally, each side would make a gesture of good will to provide a more conducive environment for talks, but in the current climate, that might be asking for too much. India-Canada rapprochement? Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s impending resignation may clear a path for New Delhi to ease deep tensions with Ottawa. Relations are in deep crisis over Canadian allegations that the Indian government is sponsoring campaigns against Sikh separatists in Canada, including a 2023 assassination in British Columbia. Meanwhile, India contends that Canada is coddling extremists who call for the establishment of a Sikh state in India known as Khalistan. Indian officials view Sikh separatists as dangerous terrorists. New Delhi has singled out Trudeau for the diplomatic crisis its only major tensions with a Western state and accuses him of appealing to Sikh separatists for political reasons. Trudeau s departure certainly isn t guaranteed to stabilize the free-falling relationship with India. Canada s investigations will continue under the next prime minister, which could bring fresh public allegations against India to light. And domestic political factors in Canada including powerful Sikh constituencies suggests that Trudeau-era policies won t necessarily change. Canadian opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, who may become the next prime minister, has criticized the rhetoric and actions of Sikh separatists in Canada but some Indian commentators say that he hasn t gone far enough. Still, the leadership transition provides an opportunity for a fresh start for New Delhi. Tibet earthquake felt in South Asia. A massive earthquake that struck Tibet on Jan. 7 affected a few South Asian states. The epicenter was near the border with Nepal, and Kathmandu residents reported shaking in their homes. Tremors were also felt in Bhutan and the northern Indian state of Bihar. Despite some injuries and property damage, no deaths were reported in Nepal, Bhutan, or India. But the earthquake was an unsettling reminder of how vulnerable these parts of South Asia are to temblors along the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. One of the most destructive of these seismic activities in recent years was the 2015 Nepal earthquake that killed around 9,000 people. Under the Radar On Jan. 7, former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia flew out of Dhaka on an air ambulance sent by the Qatari government. After a brief stopover in Doha, she arrived in London the next day for immediate medical treatment. Zia, the 79-year-old ailing leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), suffers from liver disease and other chronic ailments. Her personal physician said this week that she may need a liver transplant, noting that she might travel to the Johns Hopkins Hospital in the United States for additional treatment. The BNP is the main rival of the Awami League the party of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh amid mass protests last August. Zia spent time in detention on corruption charges during the latter part of the Hasina era, and her condition may have worsened after her time in prison. Zia s health also might have raised succession questions. The BNP, like the Awami League, has long been run by a family dynasty. It was founded by Zia s late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who served as president from 1977 until his assassination in 1981. Zia assumed leadership of the party soon afterward. In recent years, her son Tarique Rahman, who is based in London, has taken on a greater role in the party. At the same time, a few senior BNP leaders based in Bangladesh, led by secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, have also exerted more authority. The succession plan might take on more urgency when Bangladesh s interim government, which has no formal BNP representation, announces a timeframe for elections. The BNP has called for polls to take place soon, and they would be favored to win. Regional Voices A Dawn editorial expresses cautious optimism about a new peace accord intended to end years of violence in the northwestern Pakistani region of Kurram, but it warns that it shouldn t be taken for granted: The recently concluded peace deal offers a roadmap to lasting calm, but it can only work if the state has the will to enforce it, and the local tribes agree to abide by all its points.

I don t think he s kidding, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican of North Dakota. I do think he s serious about the Panama Canal and what that s cost us in ceding it. But I don t know how realistic it is to get control back or what it would take. He added: I don t really want to invade Denmark, but I think it s hard to deny that Greenland would be a really nice strategic piece of property if we could get it, he said while adding he didn t think American troops should be used for these purposes. I certainly see Greenland as an opportunity, a great national security addition, said Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican of Kansas. The Panama Canal, I certainly understand President Trump s concerns that China has a huge presence there now. And that s being abused. That s a national security issue. We ll see what happens. Sen.

TK_Doc3_Biden-Loan-Halted.docx,"WASHINGTON A federal appeals court Friday temporarily stopped the Biden administration from moving forward with its plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student-loan debt for millions of Americans. The Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the halt in a one-page order that will remain in place for a short period while it considers a request by Republican leaders in six states to block implementation of the program. The Biden administration has said in court filings that it wouldn t discharge any student-loan debt before Oct. 23. The appeals court order at least pushes back that start date a few days, though White House officials have said it could take weeks to process the bulk of the applications. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that the order doesn t prevent borrowers from applying for the program or the administration from reviewing applications. We will continue to move full speed ahead in our preparations in compliance with this order, Ms. Jean-Pierre said. And the administration will continue to fight Republican officials suing to block our efforts to provide relief to working families, she added. It s very important that the legal issues involving presidential power be analyzed by the court before transferring over $400 billion in debt to American taxpayers, said Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson, who is part of the appeal. The Biden administration estimates the debt relief would cost $379 billion over 30 years, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a similar estimate of around $400 billion that assumed 90% of eligible borrowers would apply. Friday s decision by the appeals court comes one day after a federal judge in Missouri denied a request by the group of Republican state leaders to block the program. The appeals court, which is hearing an appeal of the Missouri judge s order, set a briefing schedule with deadlines early next week. The development comes just hours after President Biden touted his efforts to forgive student loans during a speech at a Delaware university on Friday. Mr. Biden praised the Thursday ruling and pointed to a separate move by the Supreme Court to deny an emergency appeal to block implementation of the program brought by a group of Wisconsin taxpayers. The courts, the president argued earlier Friday, had sent a message: We re on Biden s side. The administration on Monday began accepting applications for loan forgiveness through an online portal that requires applicants to provide only basic information such as their legal names, Social Security numbers and email addresses. Officials have said it would take several weeks to process the applications. Some applicants will be asked for additional information to verify their incomes. So far, nearly 22 million borrowers have applied for forgiveness through the program, Mr. Biden said. The site hasn t experienced any major technical issues, according to administration officials and analysts tracking the issue. The Education Department has begun informing some borrowers that they don t need to apply for the program because the department already has enough information about their loans to process their forgiveness. In emails to borrowers who don t need to apply, the department said they have the right to opt out of the program if, for example, they are concerned about having to pay state taxes on the debt that is forgiven. Those borrowers have until Nov. 14 to alert their loan servicers that they are opting out of the program, according to the department emails. The administration has estimated that roughly eight million people fall into this category.",neutral,2,1,oppose
DR_Doc5_Offshore_Ban_Revoke.docx,"Title: How Trump May Be Able to Stop Biden s Ban on New Offshore Drilling Authors: Gore, D Angelo Source/Date: FactCheck.org, January 14, 2025 URL: Keywords: drilling, federal, ban, offshore, Trump Total Word Count: 688 Brief Summary: President-elect Donald Trump said that when he takes office he will immediately reverse President Joe Biden s recent executive action making more than 625 million acres of U.S. coastal waters off limits for new offshore drilling. But Trump s intent to quickly unban any future oil and gas drilling in those areas may not be as simple as he suggests. That s because Biden issued his ban using authority granted to presidents by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, a 1953 law that allows presidents to protect unleased lands of the outer continental shelf from oil and gas development. In 2019, a federal judge ruled that any such prohibition could be overturned by Congress but not a future president. Here, we ll explain what Biden did and how Trump may be able to stop it. Biden took executive action on Jan. 6 to protect much of the U.S. coastline from more exploratory drilling. He issued two presidential memorandums that withdrew more than 625 million acres of coastal waters from potentially being leased for new oil and natural gas production. The areas covered by the actions are the eastern U.S. Atlantic coast; the eastern Gulf of Mexico; the Pacific Coast along California, Oregon and Washington; and portions of the Northern Bering Sea in Alaska. States have rights to the resources in the area that is three nautical miles, or more in some cases, from their coastlines, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. But the federal government has jurisdiction over the outer continental shelf, which extends beyond the state jurisdiction. Biden acted using the authority granted to presidents under section 12(a) of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and this is not the first time that he has done so. Biden previously used his authority in January 2021, to protect part of the Northern Bering Sea, and in March 2023, he withdrew nearly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea in the U.S. Arctic Ocean from future oil and gas drilling. In 2020, Trump, citing the same law as Biden, issued his own presidential memorandum making parts of the coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina unavailable to be leased until 2032. With Biden s recent actions, the White House said the president has now conserved more than 670 million acres of U.S. federal land and waters. After Biden s ban was announced this month, Trump said that he would quickly end it. But he may not be able to do so on his own. In fact, in 2017, Trump was unsuccessful in trying to reverse bans on new drilling in parts of the Arctic Ocean that were implemented by President Barack Obama. Trump issued an executive order to undo Obama s bans, but in 2019, a federal district judge in Alaska, Sharon Gleason, an Obama appointee, ruled that Trump s order was unlawful and invalid because the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act does not allow a president to repeal a withdrawal made by another president. The Trump administration appealed the decision, but a higher court never weighed in before Biden took office in January 2021 and revoked Trump s executive order. After Biden s revocation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit dismissed the case as moot. This time, Trump could issue another executive order and hope that it survives a legal challenge. Another option is for Trump to work with the Republican-controlled Congress on legislation that would amend Biden s ban or rescind it. In her email, Wiseman noted that Gleason s 2019 ruling said that Congress could override a leasing ban by either revoking the withdrawal itself ... or amending Section 12(a) to expressly provide that a future President could also revoke a prior presidential withdrawal. The reconciliation process would allow the Senate to pass a bill with a simple majority instead of the 60 votes required to stop a potential filibuster.",neutral,2,1,oppose
JY_Doc4_Project_2025_Attack_Education.txt,"Presidential campaigns rarely state their specific policy positions, often leaving voters to fill in the gaps. But the Heritage Foundation s Project 2025, written predominantly by high-level Trump aides, offers a uniquely detailed playbook of what a second Trump term would mean for each function of government. Among the most radical changes proposed are the alterations to K-12 education policy. Here, we focus on three of Trump s proposed areas of change that would dramatically reshape public education in the United States: eliminating the Head Start program, defunding Title I, and introducing culture war issues into classrooms. If implemented, these changes would hurt students, families, and educators from coast to coast. The Head Start program was created in 1965 as part of Lyndon Johnson s War on Poverty. Across its 59-year history, it has helped 39 million families and currently serves 833,000 children each year through comprehensive education, health care, nutrition, and family services for children living in poverty. Head Start recognizes that the first five years of a child s life are critical to their long-term development. When they are provided key services and support early on, children are more likely to lead productive and healthy lives and rely less on taxpayer-funded programs later in life. And beyond the long-term benefits, Head Start also provides immediate relief to lower-income families who spend as much 36% of their income on child care alone. Yet Trump s Project 2025 advocates for the complete elimination of the Office of Head Start and the Head Start program it administers. It claims that Head Start is fraught with scandal and abuse and that the program provides little or no long-term academic value for children. But the data show Head Start dramatically improves the lives of its participants. Children enrolled in Head Start are 40% more likely to finish college, 23% less likely to end up in poverty, and 27% less likely to depend on public assistance. In fact, the $12 billion spent on Head Start each year yields $84 billion in value as measured by increased earnings and decreased reliance on social services. Reduced poverty and higher educational attainment are hard to square with the claim that Head Start provides no long-term value for children. The sad irony is that if Trump wins and eliminates Head Start, it will be rural Republican districts who suffer most. Children in rural counties are 37% more likely to live in poverty than their urban counterparts, so they re more likely to rely on Head Start for child care and early childhood education. A study by the Center for American Progress found that a third of all rural child care centers are Head Start Programs. Often, Head Start is the only child care available for these families. Students in rural areas already lag their contemporaries across key education metrics, Trump s education cuts would only widen the gap.",oppose,1,1,oppose
TK_Doc2_Biden-39B-Forgiveness.docx,"More than 800,000 older borrowers will see their federal student debt disappear. Student loan borrowers on income-driven repayment plans who have made 20 or 25 years of payments will get their remaining balances wiped out in coming weeks, the Education Department said. Eligible borrowers will be notified starting Friday. A total of $39 billion will be forgiven as part of a one-time adjustment to loan repayment plans the Biden administration announced last year. Separate from the higher-profile $430 billion program the Supreme Court struck down in late June, this one-time adjustment will give borrowers credit retroactively for months that previously hadn t been counted. Income-driven plans for federal student debt tie monthly payments to a borrower s family size and income and forgive any remaining balances after 20 or 25 years of payments. The Education Department said that inaccurate payment counts in the past resulted in borrowers losing progress toward loan forgiveness. For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said of the adjustment Friday. In this one-time adjustment, some borrowers will move closer to forgiveness and others will see their loans discharged. Some might receive a refund for previous payments, should the adjustment result in a borrower having exceeded the number of months required. Income-driven repayment plans were designed to help low-earning borrowers repay their student loans, but few have been able to use them effectively because of technical problems and onerous paperwork, officials said. Borrowers whose loans were in forbearance or deferred due to economic hardships for a time will have those months credited toward their repayment histories. This applies to those with Direct Loans or Federal Family Education Loans and who are currently participating in income-driven repayment plans or were previously enrolled in one. The Education Department previously made a similar adjustment to those in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Once these payments are accounted for, borrowers will see their loan balances automatically discharged or reduced in the coming weeks. The adjustment will mainly benefit those who have struggled to make progress on eliminating their debt despite nearly two decades of payments. This is not a fix to anything going forward, said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a nonprofit trade association for student loan servicers. This is a one-time fix where they re counting statuses that were not permitted to be counted in the past. Those currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans or the public-service plan will be able to get credit for partial or late payments. Those who enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan called Saving on Valuable Education, or SAVE, will be able to make much smaller payments and still see that payment count toward forgiveness. Borrowers making under $32,800 a year, or $67,500 for a family, won t owe loan payments. In such cases, those months will still count toward their path to forgiveness. For the millions of borrowers not on income-driven repayment plans and still hoping for forgiveness, the Education Department said the secretary is considering other ways to provide debt relief. After the Supreme Court struck down the previous plan proposed by the Biden administration, President Biden said he would try using a different authority, the Higher Education Act of 1965, to launch a new program.",neutral,2,1,oppose
SKSK_Doc4_ Biden-Harris-strengthening-healthcare-cybersecurity.txt,"FACT SHEET: Biden- Harris Administration Bolsters Protections for Americans Access to Healthcare Through Strengthening Cybersecurity Recent cyberattacks targeting the nation s healthcare system have demonstrated the vulnerability of our hospitals and payment systems. Providers across the health system had to scramble for funding after one attack on a key payment system. And some hospitals had to redirect care after another. These disruptions can take too long to resolve before full access to needed health care services or payment systems is restored. Cyberattacks against the American healthcare system rose . 128% from 2022 to 2023 In February and March of 2024 alone, the United States experienced one of the most significant healthcare-related cyberattacks to date. During the attack, providers reported that one out of every three health care claims in the United States were impacted, leading to disruptions in timely payment to healthcare providers. Recognizing that effective cybersecurity is critical to Americans accessing the care they need, the Biden-Harris Administration is working relentlessly to improve the resilience of the healthcare sector to cyberattacks. Many healthcare companies are private sector owned and operated, so private sector uptake and partnership is key to meaningful improvements in the sector s ability to withstand attacks.

Participants shared their organization s views on cybersecurity challenges and the need to work together with government to better share threat intelligence and adopt secure-by design solutions for the technologies underpinning the healthcare system. In May of 2024, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) announced the launch of the Universal Patching and Remediation for Autonomous Defense (UPGRADE) program, a cybersecurity effort that will invest more than $50 million to create tools for information technology (IT) teams to better defend the hospital environments they are tasked with securing. Healthcare-related cyber disruptions can be particularly disruptive to rural hospitals, which serve over 60 million Americans. Most rural hospitals are critical access hospitals, meaning they are located more than 35 miles from another hospital, which makes diversions of patients and staffing-intensive manual workarounds in response to attacks more difficult. Recognizing the critical role these hospitals play in the communities they serve, the White House worked with and received commitments from leading U.S. technology providers to provide free and low-cost resources for all 1,800-2,100 rural hospitals across the nation. As part of this initiative to improve security and resilience of our rural hospital system, our private sector partners have committed to the following: For independent Critical Access Hospitals and Rural Emergency Hospitals, Microsoft is extending its nonprofit program to provide grants and up to a 75% discount on security products optimized for smaller organizations. For participating larger rural hospitals already using eligible Microsoft solutions, Microsoft is providing its most advanced security suite at no additional cost for one year. Microsoft will also provide free cybersecurity assessments by qualified technology security providers and free training for frontline and IT staff at eligible rural hospitals throughout the country to deepen our resiliency to malicious cyberattacks. Additionally, Microsoft will extend security updates for Window 10 to participating hospitals for one year at no cost. 2/3 1/12/25, 9:05 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Bolsters Protections for Americans Access to Healthcare Through Strengthening C... Google will provide endpoint security advice to rural hospitals and non profit organizations at no cost, and eligible customers can get discounted pricing for communication and collaboration tools and security support and a pool of funding to support software migration.

JY_Doc1_schools_possible_immigration_raids.txt,"Schools around the country are reviewing what to do if immigration agents come knocking as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office after campaigning on a pledge to deport millions of people. In several large cities, school systems are speaking up for the rights of immigrant students to attend school, regardless of whether they are in the country legally, and saying they would not assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In California, officials this week offered guidance to schools on state law limiting local participation in immigration enforcement. I know there is a lot of fear and anxiety around the incoming administration s anticipated changes to immigration policy, California Attorney General Bonta said, and I want to make sure students, their parents, and their teachers and school administrators are prepared. The 54-page California guide outlines state and federal protections for students and procedures for responding to law enforcement requests ranging from documents to interviews with students. Many communities debated how much and whether schools should cooperate with immigration authorities during Trump s first administration, when school systems including Chicago s took stands against immigration enforcement. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents have long abided guidance that deters arresting parents or students at schools and other sensitive locations that provide access to things like medical care and food and shelter. But Trump s re-election and campaign rhetoric on immigration policy have sparked discussions over whether those policies will stand. Although the protected area policy remains in effect ... it may be modified, superseded, or withdrawn at any time with little notice, the California guidance said. Because of this, and because exceptions to the policy exist, local educational agencies should have plans in place in the event that a law-enforcement officer requests information or access to a school site or a student for immigration-enforcement purposes. A Trump transition spokesperson did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. An estimated 733,000 school-aged children are in the U.S. illegally, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Educators are acting at least in part to address the concerns of immigrant families and assure them their children are welcome and safe at school. We understand that fear and uncertainty, especially concerning the potential deportation of family members, can significantly impact our students well-being, their attendance, and their ability to learn, Des Moines, Iowa Public Schools, where one of four students are English language learners, said in a statement last month. The district affirmed a 2017 resolution limiting interactions with ICE officials to the superintendent. A resolution passed by Chicago Public Schools Board of Education in November said schools would not assist ICE in enforcing immigration law. Agents would not be allowed into schools without a criminal warrant, it said. And New York City principals last month were reminded by the district of policies including one against collecting information a student s immigration status. Vermont principal Chris Young said his district, whose students include children of migrant workers and farm workers, has a longstanding policy of requiring outside law enforcement to produce a warrant if they want access to students. Clearly, students who are worried about their parents being deported or being deported themselves, I think, are high on our list of kids to worry about, said Young, principal at North County Union High School and president-elect of the Vermont Principals Association. We would like them to think that school is obviously a safe place and we are doing everything we can to bolster our policies around who can and can t be in the buildings, he said, and we want to make sure that we re just keeping the needs of the kids at the forefront.

JY_Doc2_Potential_Shutdown_Education_Department.txt,"Incoming-President Donald Trump's second term is expected to have its share of shake-ups. Trump has promised to shut down several government agencies in an effort to reduce wasteful spending, which could have dramatic effects on the way government works. One of the agencies at risk is the United States Department of Education, which oversees and manages federal student loans and various programs that administer them. If the Education Department does go away, federal student loans will likely fall under the purview of a different government agency. While it's possible President-elect Trump could dismantle the Department of Education, doing so would necessitate a great deal of effort. Abolishing a government department requires an act of Congress, which means it would likely need bipartisan support.This also isn t the first time someone has attempted to put an end to the Department of Education. One of the most recent examples is H.R.899, To terminate the Department of Education, a bill introduced in February 2023 by Representative Thomas Massie (R-KY). Although the U.S. House of Representatives considered the bill, it hasn t made any progress. Without a government agency that focuses exclusively on education, what would happen to existing student loans? Unfortunately for borrowers, it s highly unlikely that the Trump administration would forget (or forgive) these debts altogether. If the Department of Education was dismantled, it's much more likely that an agency like the Department of Justice, Department of Labor, or Treasury Department could be put in charge of student loans. Of course, these agencies would likely need additional staff and support in order to take on the new workload.Borrowers repaying their student loans on income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are also right to worry about the future. The Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan is currently paused as we await a decision on its legality from the courts, but there s a good chance it will be struck down in the coming months. This would leave borrowers choosing from the IDR plans that are left, which may be overhauled or eliminated entirely after Trump takes office. However, a couple solutions for easing the burden of our student debt crisis have been floated by GOP leaders. For example, Representative Mike Lawler (R-NY) introduced the Affordable Loans for Students Act, which would cut interest rates for most federal student loans to 1%.Another bill, called the College Cost Reduction Act and introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC), would double the maximum Pell Grant award and prevent interest from capitalizing on student loans. It would also replace all repayment plans with two options a standard, 10-year repayment plan and a ""repayment assistance plan. Incoming-President Trump has promised to end the Department of Education, but no one s certain whether he ll be able to pull it off. All that borrowers with federal student loans can do right now is wait to see how the situation will play out and which repayment plans will still be available in 2025 and beyond.",oppose,1,1,oppose
GDR_Doc3_Quantum_Centers.txt," Title: Trump Administration Establishes $75 Million Quantum Computing Centers Authors: Maggie Miller Source/Date: The Hill, July 2020 URL: Keywords: Quantum Computing, Research Centers, Trump Administration, National Science Foundation, Investment Summary: In a major initiative to advance quantum technology, the Trump administration has announced the establishment of three new quantum computing research centers with a combined investment of $75 million. These centers, funded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal agencies, aim to position the United States as a global leader in quantum research and development. Each center will focus on specific aspects of quantum technology, including quantum communication, quantum sensing, and quantum computing hardware. These areas are seen as critical for achieving breakthroughs that can revolutionize fields such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. The centers are also designed to foster collaboration among academia, industry, and government, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for innovation. The initiative aligns with the National Quantum Initiative Act, which was signed into law in 2018 to provide a coordinated approach to quantum research across federal agencies. By investing in these research centers, the Trump administration seeks to accelerate the development of practical quantum applications that can benefit both the public and private sectors. Workforce development is a key component of the initiative. The research centers will host training programs for students and early-career researchers, aiming to address the growing demand for quantum expertise. These efforts include partnerships with universities to create quantum-focused curricula and provide hands-on research opportunities. The administration s quantum strategy also includes fostering international collaboration to establish standards and best practices for quantum technologies. By working with allied nations, the U.S. hopes to create a unified approach to addressing ethical and security concerns associated with quantum advancements. This investment in quantum computing research centers reflects the administration s recognition of the strategic importance of quantum technology. As other nations, particularly China, make significant strides in this area, the U.S. aims to ensure its leadership and maintain its competitive edge in the global quantum race.",support,0,1,oppose
NC_Doc1.docx,"Trump will not rule out force to take Panama Canal, Greenland By Steve Holland and Joseph Ax January 8, 202510:24 AM CST PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump refused on Tuesday to rule out using military or economic action to pursue acquisition of the Panama Canal and Greenland, part of a broader expansionist agenda he has promoted since winning the Nov. 5 election. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, also floated the idea of turning Canada into a U.S. state, said he would demand far higher defense spending from NATO allies and promised to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Still two weeks away from taking office, Trump has begun outlining an aggressive foreign policy with little regard to diplomatic considerations or the concerns of U.S. allies. Asked at a press conference at his Florida resort whether he could assure the world he would not use military or economic coercion as he tries to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, Trump said, ""No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security."" Trump criticized American spending on Canadian goods and military support for Canada, saying the U.S. derives no benefits from doing so, and called the border between the two countries an ""artificially drawn line."" He suggested he would impose tariffs on Denmark if it resists his offer to purchase Greenland, which he said is vital to U.S. national security. Shortly before Trump's comments, his son Don Jr. arrived in Greenland for a private visit. Denmark has said Greenland, a self-governing part of its kingdom, is not for sale. ""I don't think it's a good way forward to fight each other with financial means when we are close allies and partners,"" Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late on Tuesday in response to Trump's comments. CANADA SAYS: 'WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN' Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Melanie Joly, said on X, ""President-elect Trump's comments show a complete lack of understanding of what makes Canada a strong country. Our economy is strong. Our people are strong. We will never back down in the face of threats."" Panama's top diplomat also pushed back on the incoming U.S. leader's threat to retake the key global waterway, which the U.S. had built and owned before handing over control to the Central American nation in 1999. ""The only hands that control the canal are Panamanian and that's how it will continue to be,"" Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters on Tuesday. Ambassador Daniel Fried, a retired U.S. diplomat now with the Atlantic Council think tank, said Trump's comments painted a picture of national power as territorial expansion and compared him to a ""19th century imperialist."" Seizing Greenland, Fried said, ""would destroy NATO, because it would make us no different than Vladimir Putin,"" Russia's president. Trump's promise to rename the Gulf of Mexico echoed his previous vow to revert the name of Denali, the highest mountain peak in North America, to Mount McKinley. Former President Barack Obama changed the name of the Alaskan mountain in deference to Native Americans. Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who is expected to play a key role in looming U.S.-Mexico trade issues, appeared to dismiss Trump's call to rename the shared body of water later on Tuesday. ""Today I'd tell you if we saw each other in 30 years, the Gulf of Mexico will still be called the Gulf of Mexico,"" he said, adding that the Mexican government would not get drawn into the debate. Typically, the U.S. Board of Geographic Names sets geographic names, though presidents have also renamed geographic features via executive action. Trump said NATO members should spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense, a significant increase from the current 2% target. ""I think NATO should have 5%,"" he said. ""They can all afford it, but they should be at 5%, not 2%."" Trump has frequently complained that most NATO members are not paying their fair share, and he floated demanding an increase in NATO defense contributions during the campaign. NATO estimated that 23 of its 32 members would meet its goal of spending 2% of GDP in 2024. None of the alliance members, including the U.S., currently spends 5% of GDP on defense, according to NATO figures. Poland is the highest spender in GDP terms at 4.12%, followed by Estonia at 3.43% and the United States at 3.38%. Trump also repeated his threat that ""all hell will break out in the Middle East"" if Palestinian Hamas militants do not release by the time he takes office hostages it abducted from Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and still hold in the Gaza Strip. ""It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone,"" he said. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, told reporters he hopes to have good things to report on negotiations between Israel and Hamas by the time Trump is sworn into office. FAMILIAR GRIEVANCES The free-wheeling, hour-long press conference, Trump's second since his victory, echoed similar events during his presidential campaign. He aired a series of familiar grievances about his criminal indictments, including attacking Justice Juan Merchan, the New York judge who is scheduled to sentence Trump on Friday for falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn star. A New York appeals court denied his latest bid to halt the sentencing shortly after his press conference ended. Separately, as Trump was speaking, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigations into Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The judge, Aileen Cannon, had previously dismissed the case charging Trump with illegally retaining classified materials after leaving office. Tuesday's event took place in the ornate living room at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's Palm Beach resort. Several of Trump's senior advisers watched the proceedings, while club guests could be seen outside dining on the terrace. Trump was also asked whether it was appropriate for Elon Musk to publicly weigh in on foreign affairs. In recent weeks, the billionaire Trump ally has used his X platform to comment on European politics, including expressing support for Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany. ""I can say Elon is doing a good job, very smart guy,"" Trump said. ""I don't know the people you're talking about.""",oppose,1,1,oppose
HKK_Doc4_Republicans-RNC-Blame.txt,"Republicans at RNC blame Biden for inflation. Economists say it's misleading Speakers at the Republican National Convention this week have faulted the Biden administration for putting the nation at risk from threats that include criminals, illicit drugs -- and high prices. ""American families have been crushed by inflation,"" Michigan Senate candidate Mike Rogers told the audience in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Tuesday. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, described the ""silent creep of inflation unleashed by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris."" Some economists who spoke to ABC News took issue with the blame placed on President Joe Biden as an overstatement of his role in the price spike. Instead, they said, the bout of rapidly rising prices emerged from a supply shortage imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. Pandemic-era spending measures enacted by former President Donald Trump and Biden also contributed to the price spike, the economists added, but they differed on the share of responsibility that should be apportioned to each of the major party candidates. ""There's a long list of reasons for the high inflation. At the top of the list is the pandemic and the Russian war,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News. Some of the inflation owes to the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan signed by Biden in 2021, Zandi said. But, he added, ""It's at the bottom of the list."" The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Price increases have slowed significantly from a peak of more than 9% in June 2022, though inflation remains a percentage point higher than the Fed's target rate of 2%. Even after that progress made in the inflation fight, cumulative price increases during the Biden administration continue to take a toll on consumers, especially the rise in costs for essential goods like food and gas. Like so many economic problems, inflation emerged due to an imbalance between supply and demand. Hundreds of millions across the globe facing lockdowns replaced restaurant expenditures with online orders of couches and exercise bikes. But the demand for goods and labor far outpaced supply, as COVID-related bottlenecks slowed delivery times and infection fears kept workers on the sidelines. ""The most important factor for inflation is the recovery from the pandemic,"" Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, told ABC News. ""The process of coming back took longer than expected, in particular the supply constraints."" To supercharge the recovery, Trump and Biden enacted economic stimulus meant to support people who'd lost their jobs or faced other financial hardship. That stimulus helped bring about a speedy economic recovery from the March 2020 downturn, triggering a surge in demand and a blitz of hiring. ",neutral,2,1,oppose

In fact, in every year of the Biden-Harris Administration, we have set a new all-time record for ACA Marketplace enrollment. This record-breaking enrollment is no accident, and due to this Administration s efforts to lower health care costs and make it easier to sign up for coverage. We also made health care more affordable for Americans purchasing their health insurance on the ACA Marketplace, saving consumers an average of $800 annually on their premiums. For example, this Administration made the largest ever investment in outreach and enrollment assistance, especially those in rural or underserved communities while at the same time eliminating bureaucratic red tape that makes it harder for people to enroll in coverage. But all of these efforts to lower health care costs and expand coverage are now in danger. If Republicans in Congress take away the enhanced premium tax credits that make ACA coverage more affordable, premiums will skyrocket and people will lose coverage. For many families the results will be catastrophic: A single parent earing $50,00 per year could see their premiums increase by $1600 per year. 2/4 1/12/25, 8:57 PM FACT SHEET: Biden-Harris Administration Announces Record-Breaking 2025 Open Enrollment Period Under the Affordable C...

The Affordable Care Act Marketplaces are just one part of this Administration s commitment to health care coverage. Today, Medicaid covers about 80 million people. Thanks to the President s leadership, over one million Americans in four states now have Medicaid expansion coverage, driving total ACA-related enrollment to over 45 million. This Administration has also cut red tape to make applying for and renewing Medicaid coverage easier, and established new standards to ensure people have access to the care they need when they need it. In addition to today s record-breaking enrollment numbers, we are also releasing a report and a data chart pack detailing the Biden-Harris Administration s historic progress to improve the health of millions of Americans from making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, to tackling crises in mental health, maternal health, and more, and investing in public health infrastructure. Some highlights include: In its first year alone, President Biden s Medicare Drug Price Negotiation program outperformed expectations, achieving negotiated prices that are 38 to 79 percent lower than U.S. list prices for the ten first round negotiated drugs. These prices are $6 billion per year lower than what Medicare pays today and, once in effect, will put $1.5 billion dollars back into the pockets of Medicare beneficiaries. Seniors with Medicare are protected by the new $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket costs, and insulin is capped at just $35 per month. The Administration ended the family glitch, making millions of family members finally eligible for affordable ACA Marketplace coverage with about one million people projected to either gain coverage or have lower premiums. The 988 lifeline, created under this Administration, has answered more than 11 million calls, chats, and texts and made it easier for individuals experiencing distress to access immediate care.

YCK_Doc2_Blinken-Wang-discuss.txt,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated Washington's concerns over Beijing's actions toward Taiwan and its support for Russia's war in Ukraine as he met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Saturday. Blinken, who earlier called out China for escalating maritime tensions with the Philippines, talked extensively with Wang about Taiwan and Beijing's recent ""provocative"" actions toward the democratically governed island, a senior U.S. State Department official said. Those actions included a simulated blockade during the inauguration of Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, the official said. Blinken and Wang agreed to keep making progress on their countries' military-to-military ties, but did not discuss nuclear arms control talks, which China has halted in protest over Washington providing arms to Taiwan, the official said. ""In every discussion, Taiwan is the issue that they care most about. They see it as ... an internal China issue,"" said the official, who briefed reporters travelling with Blinken. China's government considers Taiwan inviolable Chinese territory, which Taiwan rejects. Wang told Blinken that Taiwan was part of China and ""was not and will not be a country"", and Beijing would counter provocations by forces advocating Taiwan's independence, according to a foreign ministry statement. He said that though communication channels between China and the United States were open, Washington had intensified its efforts to contain and suppress Beijing. ""The risks facing Sino-U.S. relations are still accumulating and the challenges are rising and ties are at a critical juncture of halting their decline and achieving stability,"" Wang said. The two talked for one hour, 20 minutes on the sidelines of a regional summit in Laos, in their sixth meeting since June 2023, when Blinken visited Beijing in a sign of improvement in strained relations between the world's two biggest economies. The two did not set a date for their next meeting, the official said. Blinken is touring East Asia in a bid to reassure countries close to China of U.S. commitment, despite political uncertainty at home. He travelled to Vietnam later on Saturday and was set to hold security talks alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Japan and the Philippines in the coming days. Blinken conveyed to Wang that U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, both believed in the importance of stability in the U.S.-China relationship, and that a rules-based order must be upheld, the official added. Blinken also discussed China's support for Russia's defence industrial base and warned of further U.S. actions if China does not curtail that, according to the official. Washington has levied sanctions at targets including China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of an effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine. ""There was no commitment by the Chinese to take action,"" the official said. Blinken also raised with Wang U.S. concerns over human rights in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet, and stressed the need for more progress from Beijing on counter narcotics including fentanyl precursors coming out of China.

GKF_Doc1_Trudeau-says-not.docx,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has hit back at Donald Trump's threat to use ""economic force"" to absorb Canada into the US saying there isn't ""a snowball's chance in hell"" to join the two. President-elect Trump has in recent weeks repeatedly needled Canada about it becoming the 51st US state. ""You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security,"" Trump said at a press conference at his Florida Mar-a Lago home on Tuesday. ""Canada and the United States, that would really be something."" Trump reiterated his threat to bring in a ""substantial"" tariff on Canadian goods unless the country took steps to increase security on the shared US border. The ongoing tariff threat comes at a politically challenging time for Canada. On Monday, an embattled Trudeau announced he was resigning, though he will stay on as prime minister until the governing Liberals elect a new leader, expected sometime by late March. Canada's parliament has been prorogued - or suspended - until 24 March to allow time for the leadership race. Economists warn that if Trump follows through on imposing the tariffs after he is inaugurated on 20 January, it would significantly hurt Canada's economy. Almost C$3.6bn ($2.5bn) worth of goods and services crossed the border daily in 2023, according to Canadian government figures. The Trudeau government has said it is considering imposing counter-tariffs if Trump follows through on the threat. The prime minister also said on X on Tuesday that: ""Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other's biggest trading and security partner."" During his lengthy Mar-a-Lago press conference, Trump reiterated his concerns he has expressed about drugs crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada into the US. Like Canada, Mexico faces a 25% tariff threat. The amount of fentanyl seized at the US-Canada border is significantly lower than at the southern border, according to US data. Canada has promised to implement a set of sweeping new security measures along the border, including strengthened surveillance and adding a joint ""strike force"" to target transnational organised crime. Trump said on Tuesday he was not considering using military force to make Canada part of the United States, but raised concerns about its neighbour's military spending. ""They have a very small military. They rely on our military. It's all fine, but, you know, they got to pay for that. It's very unfair,"" he said. Canada has been under pressure to increase its military spending as it continues to fall short of the target set out for Nato members. Its defence budget currently stands at C$27bn ($19.8bn, 15.5bn), though the Trudeau government has promised that it will boost spending to almost C$50bn by 2030. British Columbia Premier David Eby told a news conference on Tuesday that a number of Canadian provincial premiers will soon be travelling to Washington DC to lobby against the possible tariffs. On Monday, Doug Ford, the leader of Canada's most populous province Ontario, said Trudeau must spend his remaining weeks in office working with the provinces to address Trump's threat. ""The premiers are leading the country right now,"" he told BBC News in an interview. Ontario has a deep reliance on trade with the US. The province is at the heart of the highly integrated auto industry in Canada, and trade between Ontario and the US totalled more than C$493bn ($350bn) in 2023. ""My message is let's work together, let's build a stronger trade relationship - not weaken it,"" Ford said. Reuters The premier warned ""we will retaliate hard"" if the Trump administration follows through, and highlighted the close economic ties between the two nations, including on energy. The US relies ""on Ontario for their electricity. We keep the lights on to a million and a half homes and businesses in the US"", he said.

JR_Doc2_Fed-Cuts-Rates.txt,"Title:Fed slashes interest rates by a half point, an aggressive start to its first easing campaign in four years Authors:Cox, Jeff Source/Date: CNBC - 09/18/2024 URL: Keywords: cut, interest, rates, inflation, Powell Total Word Count:1140 Summary:The Federal Reserve on Wednesday enacted its first interest rate cut since the early days of the Covid pandemic, slicing half a percentage point off benchmark rates in an effort to head off a slowdown in the labor market. With both the jobs picture and inflation softening, the central banks Federal Open Market Committee chose to lower its key overnight borrowing rate by a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, affirming market expectations that had recently shifted from an outlook for a cut half that size. Outside of the emergency rate reductions during Covid, the last time the FOMC cut by half a point was in 2008 during the global financial crisis. The decision lowers the federal funds rate to a range between 4.75%-5%. While the rate sets short-term borrowing costs for banks,it spills over into multiple consumer productssuch as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. In addition to this reduction, the committee indicated throughits dot plot the equivalent of 50 more basis points of cuts by the end of the year, close to market pricing. The matrix of individual officials expectations pointed to another full percentage point in cuts by the end of 2025 and a half point in 2026. In all, the dot plot shows the benchmark rate coming down about 2 percentage points beyond Wednesdays move. The decision to ease came in light of progress on inflation and the balance of risks. Notably, the FOMC vote was 11-1, with Governor Michelle Bowman preferring a quarter-point move. Bowmans dissent was the first by a Fed governor since 2005, though a number of regional presidents have cast no votes during the period. Trading was volatileafter the decision with the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumping as much as 375 points after it was released, before easing somewhat as investors digested the news and considered what it suggests about the state of the economy. Stocks ended slightly lower on the day while Treasury yields bounced higher. However, Powell and other policymakers in recent days haveexpressed concern about the labor market. While layoffs have shown little sign of rebounding, hiring has slowed significantly. In fact, the last time the monthly hiring rate was this low 3.5% as a share of the labor force the unemployment rate was above 6%. At his news conference following the July meeting, Powell remarked that a 50 basis point cut was not something were thinking about right now. For the moment, at least, the move helps settle a contentious debate over how forceful the Fed should have been with the initial move. With the Fed at the center of the global financial universe, Wednesdays decision likely will reverberate among other central banks, several of whom already have started cutting. The factors that drove global inflation higher were related mainly to the pandemic crippled international supply chains, outsized demand for goods over services, and an unprecedented influx of monetary and fiscal stimulus.

Trump was roundly mocked for his latest trolling of Canada, but his apparent fixation is dangerous at a time when the country s Liberal government, long weakened, is in disarray following the shock resignation of Chrystia Freeland as finance minister and deputy prime minister. In fact, in her December resignation letter, Freeland placed the country s response to Trump at the heart of her critique of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada s wannabe leader and his wife?

Trump wasted no time inserting himself into Canada s internal affairs, calling Freeland toxic and continuing his running gag of referring to Trudeau as the governor of an American state rather than the leader of a sovereign nation. The attacks are becoming routine, with Trump suggesting in another post that Canadians would save massively on taxes and military protection as the 51st state.1/11/25, 5:43 PM Canada s fight with Trump isn t just economic, it s existential 2/7Mercedes S tephenson @MercedesGlobal -Follow President-Elect Donald T rump on Chrystia Freeland s resignation.

He s openly challenging the very idea of Canadian sovereignty. Canada must respond accordingly. It can be hard to fully understand the nature and the extent of threats posed by someone so willing to flout respected political and diplomatic conventions. His annexation threats create a constant set of multifaceted challenges to Canada s economic prosperity, democratic norms and sovereignty. The economic dimension of his threat to Canada is now well-known. Trump s proposed 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian exports to the U.S. are going to be incredibly costly to both countries, given the integration of their economies. But given the size disparity between the two countries, the impact will be bigger in Canada. The democratic threat is also clear. Trump has shown he regards democracy not as a crucial set of rules and norms, but as a set of obstacles to overcome. He s unable to admit defeat or even graciously accept victory. His revenge tour has begun, with lawsuits against media outlets and even against a pollster whose data suggested Democrat Kamala Harris was pulling ahead during the late days of the U.S. election campaign. Once back in the White House, Trump has promised to use public institutions to punish opponents. A partisan U.S. Supreme Court decision last year ensures that even if his own actions are criminal, he will remain immune from prosecution. Trump s disrespect of democratic institutions is corrosive and contagious. During his first term, experts sounded alarm bells about how he was linked to democratic decline around the world. If the U.S. president can openly challenge democratic norms, after all, what s to stop other would-be demagogues from doing the same? A second Trump administration is likely to continue such trends, and his willingness to intervene in Canadian politics is already causing shock waves north of the border.

He s made it a running joke that Canada is not a real country, but just another American state. Nervously laughing off this threat doesn t cut it as a response. Canada has so far acted in a manner that makes it seem as though Trump has a point. Rather than pushing back by defending Canada s strong record in managing its part of the border relationship, the government immediately promised more than $1 billion in new border spending. Canada s leaders have failed to call out Trump s threats as the bluster of a bully. In the face of Trump s tariff threats, Trudeau made a surprise trip to Florida to pay his respects to the president-elect and plead Canada s case, rather than observing the normal protocol and waiting for a formal post-inauguration state visit. This made Trudeau appear more like a supplicant than a visiting head of government. It s helpful in this situation to think of Trump as a schoolyard bully demanding someone else do his homework in this case, defend America s borders. Such bullying doesn t end when you give in to the bully, but only when it becomes clear you won t. Border protection is a core function of any state, and a responsibility of any American president. Trump s demand that others do it for him is both a sign of weakness and an attempt to create a scapegoat should his efforts fail. As with any bully, if you promise to do the work for him, you ll just encourage additional torment. So when Trudeau promised to do more in exchange for an end to the bullying, he got a kick in the pants for his efforts as Trump began to taunt him about being the governor of the 51st American state.

If Canada hopes to enjoy the respect of its peers, it must show a willingness to fight for itself, its prosperity and its values. It must defend its sovereignty from those who refuse to respect it, and act assertively to maintain Canadian prosperity. That could mean a trade war. Power imbalance For more than a century, Canada and the U.S. have found ways to co-operate and prosper side by side despite the fact that the U.S. is a much more powerful nation. They ve built alliances and agreements founded on shared norms, values and customs as part of a deep and multifaceted relationship. Read more: Biden-Trudeau meeting caps two and a half centuries of Canada-U.S. relations None of that history seems to matter to Trump, and now American power seemingly matters more than Canadian sovereignty. This power imbalance is all the more acute given Canada s dependence on the American economy and American military might. But Canada is not powerless. Dependency works both ways, and the deep integration of the two countries economies makes the U.S. vulnerable as well. Shutting off power exports, as Ontario Premier Doug Ford suggests, is one course of action that would have an immediate and significant detrimental effect on the American economy. Ditto for petroleum. Energy is power in more ways than one.

Other countries stand to lose if the U.S. gets away with disrespecting Canadian sovereignty as well. If Trump refuses to respect Canadian sovereignty, no country is safe. Panama and Denmark can already attest to that. Finding ways to creatively push back against such demands should be an imperative for any country that values its independence, and Canada needs to work with such allies. Trump will soon be U.S. president again. But he is not and should not be treated as the president of Canada. Whoever leads Canada in the months to come has tools at their disposal to defend Canadian sovereignty, and they must be prepared to use them.1/11/25, 5:43 PM Canada s fight with Trump isn t just economic, it s existential 7/7",oppose,1,1,oppose
NC_Doc3.docx,"Transition 2025: What Will Trump Do About Iran? Posted by James M. Lindsay January 3, 2025, 5:29 pm (EST) One of the many complex foreign policy problems that Donald Trump will inherit when he takes office in just over two weeks is Iran. It is on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, its robust ballistic missile program continues to progress, and it sees the United States as the main obstacle to its domination of the Middle East. How will Trump respond? That question is easy to answer because Trump has been consistent about his plans: He will return to his first administration s policy of maximum pressure. That effort sought to turn the economic screws on Iran by expanding U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic and ratcheting up the enforcement of sanctions already in place. The goal was not regime change but rather forcing Tehran to limit its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and curb support for the regional militias that made up the so-called axis of resistance. Maximum pressure certainly squeezed the Iranian economy. It failed, however, to force Tehran to the bargaining table. Even as its economy faltered and its foreign reserves dwindled, Iran continued its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, expanded its support for its regional proxies, and even launched a missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq in 2020. Top of Form Bottom of Form Would the maximum pressure campaign have paid off had the Biden administration kept it in place? Trump thinks so. But that is for historians and partisans to debate. The question now is, will maximum pressure work in today s very different geopolitical context? The evidence on that score is mixed. Israel s wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, have weakened Iran s position in the region. Its proxies are fewer and weaker than just six months ago. Beyond that, Israel s October retaliatory air strikes destroyed much of Iran s air defenses, leaving it open to further military attacks. That vulnerability, coupled with Iran s economic woes and domestic unrest, may be why Iran s foreign minister said today that Iran is looking to resume nuclear talks. By the same token, however, a maximum pressure strategy takes time to work. That could be in short supply, at least when it comes to Iran s nuclear program. Iran intensified its uranium-enrichment efforts after Trump terminated the 2015 nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated. By most estimates, Iran can now build a small number of nuclear weapons within weeks of deciding to cross the nuclear threshold. Other great powers will also undermine the maximum pressure policy. China and Russia have both skirted or ignored existing U.S. and multilateral sanctions on Iran. They are unlikely to comply with them now unless they get something significant from the United States in return. Trump may be unwilling or unable to provide that enticement. If Tehran believes that Beijing and Moscow have its back, resistance becomes a more feasible strategy. Tehran could even use negotiations as a way to buy time to address its vulnerabilities. Even if Iran enters into negotiations in good faith, Trump s efforts could stumble over deciding what deal is good enough. The ideological diversity of his team, composed as it is of hardliners and American Firsters, makes it likely they will argue over what Tehran needs to concede to make a deal worthwhile. That internal division could torpedo the effort to get a deal. All of this raises the question of what happens if talks either do not begin or, perhaps more likely, go nowhere once they do. Calls for the United States to attack Iran s nuclear sites are likely to mount if the maximum pressure campaign does not produce quick results. Trump will also likely hear calls that he should encourage Israel to attack Iran, though Israel lacks the capability to destroy Iran s underground nuclear facilities. Tehran will be assessing Trump s willingness to use military force, as well as Israel s military capabilities, as it thinks about negotiations. Iranian leaders know he ordered the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020, spoke on the campaign trail about blowing Iran to smithereens, and has said that Israel should hit Iran s nuclear sites. But they also know that he campaigned against America s forever wars in the Middle East while boasting, wrongly, that he is the only president in seventy-two years that had no wars. And they have to assess whether efforts by Iranian agents to assassinate Trump, something they have denied, might influence his thinking about military options. Resorting to military force, whether with direct U.S. action or by encouraging Israel to attack, would be a major roll of the dice. It might succeed beyond its planners wildest dreams and usher in a new, more peaceful era in the Middle East. Or, like the invasion of Iraq, it may open a Pandora s Box of problems that will haunt the region and the United States for years to come. But, and this is always worth keeping in mind, letting Iran continue its nuclear and ballistic missile programs while it rebuilds its axis of resistance has costs of its own. So here s to hoping that a return to the maximum pressure strategy works, and we discover that the Trump administration has indeed mastered the art of the deal. What Trump Is Saying Trump is famous for his pugnacious and often uncivil attacks on political opponents. So it is worth noting his respectful comments on the passing of former President Jimmy Carter. Trump first posted his gratitude for Carter s service and extended his condolences to the Carter family. An hour later, he added that Carer had worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect. Meanwhile, Trump s supporters waged a mini-civil war over the weekend on whether to end the H-1B visa program. That is the immigration classification that allows employers who say they cannot fill skilled positions with U.S. workers to hire foreign workers instead. Elon Musk led the chorus of those who favor continuing the program; Steve Bannon led the chorus of those opposed. Trump eventually weighed in Musk s side, saying that H-1B visas are a great program and his properties rely on many H-1B visas to operate. It is unlikely, however, that Trump has made much use of H-1B visas, which are for highly skilled workers, during his business career. He may have confused H-1B visas with H-2B visas, which enable unskilled foreign workers to work legally in the United States. In any event, Trump has not always defended the H-1B visa program. In 2016, he vowed to overhaul if not end the program. He tried but failed during his first term. When pressed on the discrepancy in his views, Trump said: I didn t change my mind. Trump commented on a post by tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, who marveled at a chart showing that tariffs have gone from constituting the primary source of federal revenue to a negligible portion. The incoming president declared that Americans were never so wealthy as when tariffs reigned supreme. No, Americans were not wealthier in the 1890s than they are today. They were decidedly poorer. And higher tariffs will not solve America s deficit and debt woes. The United States simply does not import enough goods for tariffs to generate anywhere near enough revenue to close the annual budget deficit, let alone generate a surplus that will pay down the debt. Stemming the flow of red ink in Washington requires cutting spending and raising income taxes. Full stop. What the Biden Administration Is Doing President Joe Biden announced today that he is blocking Nippon Steel s proposed purchase of U.S. Steel. The decision fell to Biden after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government entity charged with reviewing major foreign investments in the United States, deadlocked on a recommendation. Biden justified his decision on the grounds that we need major U.S. companies representing the major share of US steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America s national interests. Trump said last month that he would also block the deal. The issue will now likely head to the courts. Whatever the outcome of that litigation, Biden s decision has strained U.S. relations with Japan, which is understandably piqued that the United States would see an investment by a close ally as a threat to national security. The Biden administration announced on Monday that Chinese government hackers penetrated computer networks at the Treasury Department. The attacks targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which handles U.S. sanctions on countries and individuals, as well as the Office of the Treasury Secretary. The hackers somehow stole a key used by the vendor that maintains Treasury s cloud-based services and then used the key to override the service s security, remotely access certain Treasury DO [departmental offices] user workstations, and access certain unclassified documents maintained by those users. The Biden administration announced on Monday that it is providing another $2.5 billion in military aid and $3.4 billion in civil and economic aid to Ukraine. This new package exhausts most of the funds that Congress appropriated for Ukraine last April. The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Iranian and Russian entities that it claimed attempted to interfere in the 2024 election. The Iranians reportedly used social engineering techniques to access the computers of people in both parties who had direct access to the presidential campaigns. The Russians reportedly used generative AI to create disinformation that it distributed across websites. The U.S. Navy this week conducted additional air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. The periodic airstrikes, which began last March, have yet to succeed in their goal of ending Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. What the Pundits Are Writing Alina Polyakova argued in Foreign Affairs that Trump needs to first increase the pressure on Russia if he hopes to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. She writes: Trump has said that he aims to pursue a deal with Putin, and he is right to want to bring a lasting and sustainable peace to a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and has destabilized geopolitics around the globe. But to achieve that aim, his administration will first need to get the Russians to the table with a willingness to negotiate and make meaningful compromises that will lead to more than a short-term cease-fire. Newsweek s Tom O Connor summarized ten overseas conflicts that Trump will face when he takes office. The Israel-Gaza and Russia-Ukraine conflicts lead O Connor s list. He concludes that given the potential for some of the most volatile of these ongoing conflicts to directly impact U.S. interests at a time when the nation is engaged in a global great power competition with rivals such as China and Russia, the stakes are high in the second Trump administration's efforts to revamp foreign policy in order to Make America Great Again on the world stage. What the Polls Show Gallup asked Americans to predict how 2025 will go. They were more optimistic about the U.S. economy than U.S. foreign policy. While they see rising stock prices and full employment in the year ahead, they also see a year of rising Chinese and Russian power and an increasing number of international disputes.",neutral,2,1,oppose
